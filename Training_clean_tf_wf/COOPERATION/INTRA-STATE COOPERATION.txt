Abstract  The  aim  of this  thesis  is  to  advance  a  theory  of friendship  and  estrangement  between  states as an explanation for the emergence and decline of interstate security cooperation,  defined  as  costly  investment  in  a  shared  international  institution.
It  seeks to  illuminate  dynamics  in  (West)German-American  relations  between  1945  and  1995,  specifically  Germany’s subsequent investment in three different security  institutions for the purpose  of ‘European  security’  which  gradually  excluded  the  United  States:  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (1945-55),  the  Conference  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (1965-75)  and  the  EU’s  Common  Foreign  and  Security  Policy  (1985-95).
Suggesting  that  the  three  dominant  IR  paradigms -   realism,  institutionalism  and  constructivism  -   cannot  explain  this  dynamic, the  thesis  applies  a  phenomenological  lens  to  explore  the  parameters  of the  national  security  interest  and  the  motivation  for  security  cooperation  by interrogating what it means for the state to exist.
Combining  insights  from  Heidegger  and  Aristotle,  the  first  part  argues  that  states  (i)  attempt to control anxiety through the formulation of an authentic biographical narrative  inscribed  in  space  and  time,  and  that  they  (ii)  attempt  to  stabilize  their  narrative  by  embedding  it  in  a  project  of  ‘world  building’  negotiated  with  friends  through  shared  institutions.

The  overarching  question  addressed  is  ‘what  explains  the  emergence  (rise)  and  decline  (demise)  of  interstate  security  cooperation?’  Defining  interstate  security  cooperation  as  the  costly  investment  in  a  shared  international  institution,  the  thesis  applies this  question to the empirical  case of German1  -American2  cooperation  between  1945  explain  Germany’ssubsequent investments in three different security  institutions for the purpose  of  ‘European  security’,  namely  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO),  the  Conference  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (CSCE)  and  the  EU’s  Common  Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).
Specifically,   it  develops  a   and   theoretical   frame   to   Seen  in  the  context  of  German-American  relations,  these  investments  are  taken  as  indicators for the emergence and decline of security cooperation  between  Germany and  the  United  States  (US).
Specifically,  they  signify  a  dynamic  moving  from  shared  commitment to  NATO  as  the  primary  security  institution  in  Europe  (‘consensus’),  via  differing  commitments  to  the  CSCE  process  marked  by  strong  German  support  and  American  reluctance to  participate (‘tension’), to German  investment in  CFSP as  a new  institution  in  which  the  US  was  not  a  member  and  which  US  administrations  viewed  with  suspicion  (‘divergence’).
In  short,  the  question  can  be  posed  as  ‘why  did  German  governments  invest  in three different security  institutions  in  Europe since the end  of the  Second World War which gradually excluded the United States?’  The  relevance of engaging these questions  is not difficult to see.
Dynamics of interstate  security cooperation  are  integral to the  dynamics of war and  peace  and  so  investigating  them  is  a well  established  exercise  in the  field  of International  Relations  (IR),  if not  its  core  concern.
Yet  for the  most part this  does  not entail  scrutinizing the  motivations,  or  shared  ‘security  interests’,  on  which  decisions  for  cooperation  are  based.
Rather  than  fixing  them  on  the  level  of  assumptions,  this  thesis  problematizes  the  meaning  of  ‘security  interests’  by  building  on  literature  pointing  to  their  political  and  context-  specific nature.
9  state  and  the  parameters  within  which  is  formulated  and,  consequently, within which  ‘common’  security  interests  must be  situated  to  understand  when security cooperation is likely to occur, endure, and decline.
its  ‘security  interest’   The theoretical exploration of these parameters makes up a significant part of the thesis.
In  a  nutshell,  the  argument  advanced  is  that  common  institutional  investments  signify  projects of ‘world  building’  among friends driven by the attempt to control  ‘anxiety’  by  establishing  an  authentic  biographical  narrative.
The  decline  of such  relations,  marked  by the decision  of at least one side to  invest in  an  alternative  institution  which  does  not  include the previous partner,  is said to be a reaction to a process of estrangement and the  decision to pursue a strategy of emancipation.
With developing this argument, this thesis  is  not  merely  offering  an  explanation  for  the  aforementioned  dynamics  of  German-  American  security  cooperation  but  is  also  outlining  a  new  theory  of interstate  security  cooperation  The  German-American  relationship  between  1945  and  1995  provides  an  important  and  challenging  case  for  exploring  dynamics  of  interstate  security  cooperation.
It  is  hoped  that  by  “expanding  the  data  base”  (Gaddis,  1987)  the  findings  of this  thesis  will  allow  scholars  and  practitioners to  better  understand  the  opportunities  and  limits  of US-German  cooperation  today  and  improve  expectations about their support for security institutions  in Europe in the future.
The challenge is that by most measures these two states make for rather unequal partners  and,  for a significant part of the  period  under investigation,  appear in  a hegemon-client  relationship marked by one-sided dependency rather than eye-to-eye cooperation.
Supporting  the  scholarly  agenda  of  decentering  Cold  War  history,  it  pays  particular  attention  to  the  German  role  to  assess  and  retrieve  the  agency  governments  in  Bonn  exercised during the periods  in which those three  institutions emerged:  (i) The post-war  decade  (1945-55)  characterized  by  a  consensus  about  NATO  as  the  primary  security  10  institution  in  Europe, (ii) the period  of Ostpolitik/detente (1965-75)  showing differences  in  opinion  over the  need  and  relevance  of CSCE,  and  (iii)  the  decade  surrounding the  end  of the  Cold  War (1985-95)  marked  by  German  investment  in  CFSP  as  a  potential  alternative  institution  to  NATO  and  from  which  the  US  is  excluded.
Applying  the  theoretical  argument mentioned  earlier,  this  dynamic  is  explained  with  (dis)agreements  among political  leaders over visions of European order embedded  in respective national  biographies,  signifying  a  movement  of  German-American  security  relations  from  friendship to estrangement, culminating in Bonn’s emancipation by investing in CFSP.
Contribution The  theoretical  contribution  can  be  summarised  as  follows:  in  addition  to  offering  a  certain understanding of ‘theory’  in  IR, this thesis contributes to the analytical toolkit by  advancing a  new  causal  narrative  made  up  of three  building blocks:  (i) the  notion  that  states  are  driven  by  an  attempt  to  control  anxiety,  (ii)  an  ontology  of the  state  as  a  national  biography inscribed  in space and time and (iii) a conceptualization  of interstate  relations  as  ‘friendship’  and  an  argument for the  formation and  the  breakdown thereof.
As  for the  empirical  contribution,  I  am  not  aware  of an  analysis  of German-American  security  cooperation  that  focuses  on  the  question  outlined  above.
Second,  it  strengthens  the  view  that  the  security  interdependence  between  Germany and  the  US  was  generated  internally  rather  than  by  an  external  threat.
In  other  words,  it  treats  NATO,  CSCE  and  CFSP  as  ‘equals’  by  starting  from  the  premise  that  they  all  deal  with  ‘European  security’  and  takes  their  difference  in  design  as  an  invitation  to  explore  how  states  come  to  have  different  understandings about what makes ‘Europe’  secure.
is   to  clarify   Defining the Puzzle A  ‘puzzle’  is  an  intellectual  challenge  posed  by  an  empirical  phenomenon  against  the  backdrop of existing theories,  or ways  of understanding how the  world  works.
3 For an overview of theories of security cooperation, see Jervis (1999); Mueller (2002).
Taken together, cooperation thus  requires  the  convergence  of policies  through  a  process  of mutual  coordination  and  voluntary  adjustment.
In  this  sense,  following  Grieco (1990) and  Stein (1990),  cooperation  is defined  as costly  investment in  a shared  institutions (or regime) on the international level over a period of time.
Institutions  are  understood  here  along  the  lines  of  Stephen  Krasner’s  well-known  definition  as  “sets  of implicit  or  explicit  principles,  norms,  rules  and  decision-making  procedures around which actors’  expectations converge” (Krasner,  1983:  2) and  refer to  political  agreements  and  treaties  outlining  common  aims,  means,  and  responsibilities  incorporated  in  formal  organizations  (Hasenclever  et  al.,  1996).
What  is  required  is  costly  investment  in the shared  institution, understood as the mobilization of significant political capital to  influence  the  establishment/reform  of  organizational  elements  and/or  use  of  the  same.
Cooperation  as  substantial  and  reciprocated  political  and  financial  investment towards common practices,  ranging from  consultation  and  shared  strategic  planning  to  common  action  in  crisis  situations,  inevitably  involves  the  conscious  sacrifice  of some  degree  of  independence  (Wolfers,  1962:27).
Non-cooperation  thus  may  be  expressed  in  both  passive  non-compliance  with  and  severe  disputes  over the  common  cause,  and  in  the  independent  formulation  and  pursuit  of  policy  against  the  expectation  of  shared  practice.
As  it  is  difficult  to  establish  a  threshold  for  when  non-compliance,  disputes  and  independent decision-making count as non-cooperation, the favouring of an  ‘alternative’  is  an  important  element.5  To  be  an  alternative the  new  institution  must cover the  same  policy  realm  and  designed  to  fulfil  a  similar  purpose,  thus  having,  or  be  perceived  as  having,  the  potential  to  rival  or  compete  with  the  old  institution  (Biermann  2007).6  Hence, inversing the definition of cooperation outlined earlier, the demise of cooperative  relationship  is  defined  here  as  a  process  in  which  a  state  ceases  to  give  priority  to  the  common  security  institution,  signified  by  costly  investment  in  an  alternative  institution  over a period of time which does not include the previous partner.
Through  this  conceptual  frame  Germany’s  subsequent  investment  in  three  different  institutions  for  the  purpose  of  providing  for  ‘European  security’  which  gradually  excluded the  United  States -  NATO,  CSCE,  CFSP -  reads  as  a dynamic moving  from  cooperation  to  non-cooperation.
Sorting Existing Theories While  historians  would  explore  the  three  decades  of  consensus  (1945-55);  tension  (1965-75); and divergence (1985-1995) in great detail to offer a rich and nuanced picture  of the  political  dynamics  surrounding  (and  leading  to)  the  institutional  investments  in  5  See  Albert  Hirschman’s  notion  of  ‘exit’  defined  as  a  dissatisfied  member  leaving  an  organization to join another one (Hirschman,  1970).
Indeed,  for some IR scholars meaningful analysis  is only possible “with the guidance of theory”  (Waltz  1979:  5)  holding  that  “theory  is  inescapable;  all  empirical  or  practical  analysis  rests on  it” (Keohane and Nye  1989:  4).
The  following  suggests that the  dominant IR theories  on  interstate  (security)  cooperation  fail  to  fully  explain  the  empirical  phenomenon  at  hand and that, in response to that puzzle, more careful theoretical reflection is needed.
insufficient  explanatory  guidance,   thus,  provide   The Question of the  ‘Common Security Interest' To  assess  the  adequacy  of the  dominant  IR theories7  for  explaining  interstate  security  (non)cooperation -  structural realism, neoliberal  institutionalism, social constructivism -   there is the question whether/on what basis they can be compared.
In the  present context,  the  question  of comparability  comes  to  light  of  two  concepts  generally  kept  apart  in  the  IR  literature,  namely  ‘alliances’  and ‘security communities’.
It  is  used  in  traditional  security  studies  dominated by realism and game theory and, correspondingly, is the focus of the first two  abovementioned approaches (structural realism and neoliberal  institutionalism).
15  1987;  Snyder,  1997).8  The  notion  of a  ‘security  community’  is  of more  recent  origin.
More than a simple nonaggression treaty, a  security community describes a  long-term  association among states who have agreed to  solve  all  disagreements  between  them  through  peaceful  means,  making  war  between  them “unthinkable”.9  In  short,  it  appears  alliances  are  organised  against  something  (an  external  enemy)  and  externally oriented,  whereas  security communities are organised fo r something (internal  peace),  or  internally  oriented.10  In  addition,  the  scholarly  communities  favouring  the  concepts of ‘alliances’  and  ‘security communities’  are often  seen  as embedding them  in  two  distinct ways  of thinking  about  interstate  relations,  emphasizing a certain  ‘logic  of  anarchy’  in which states pursue their interests by following a logic of consequence and a  ‘logic  of  community’  where  states  act  according  to  a  logic  of  appropriateness,  respectively.
In  at  the  conceptualizations  of  alliances  and  security  communities  build  on  common  ground.
If anything, these are two sides of the  same motivational  coin  as  both  alliances and  security communities are formed by states  for  reasons  of  ‘national  security’.
(1973:  4) define alliances as “a formal agreement between  two or more nations to collaborate on national security issues”.
Joseph Grieco (1990:  12)  understands  alliances  as  “a  formal  or  informal  arrangement  for  security  cooperation  between  two  or  more  sovereign  states”,  a  definition  almost  identical  to  the  one  put  forward by Stephen Walt (1987:  1).
10 See also Wolfer’s (1962) distinction between collective defense and collective security.
16  of  security  community,  Emmanuel  Adler  (1998:  120)  speaks  about  formations  of  “cooperative  security”  and  Thomas  Risse-Kappen  (1995)  frames  NATO  as  a  security  community  whose  members  cooperate  because  they  perceive  their  state  of security  as  interlinked.
Understanding (non)cooperation through the objective of maintaining ‘national  security’  falls  back  on  three  basic  assumptions  in  which  the  three  paradigms  converge:  First,  states  are egoistic or self-interested actors and  pursue this  interest  in a rational manner.
In  short,  rational  action refers to  behaviour “designed to  further the actor’s  perceived  self-  interest” (Monroe,  1991:  l),12 which  is another way of saying that states are  ‘egoists’  or  ‘interest-satisficers’ (Simon,  1984).13  Hence,  second,  decisions  about cooperation  can  be traced  back to  the  national security  interest of the  respective  states  involved.
Few IR scholars would contest Morgenthau’s point that “interest is  the  perennial  standard  by  which  political  action  must  be judged”  (Morgenthau,  1960:  10),  if only  because  ‘interest’  is  an  analytically  empty  concept  which  easily  becomes  tautological  unless  specified.14  Saying  that  states  seek  ‘security’  only  begets  the  subsequent question what exactly that means.
17  The need to specify and justify the reading of the  ‘national security interest’  becomes all  the  more  important  in  light  of,  third,  the  assumption  that  cooperation  is  based  on  common  (security)  interests.
Beyond  that,  specifying what  makes  security  interests  ‘common’  is  the  basic task of any theoretical explanation.
The Silence o f the Camps By specifying this  ‘common  security interest’  on the basis of which two states would be  willing to  invest in  a shared  international  institution  it is possible to compare arguments  derived  from  those  three  major  IR  theories  dealing  with  international  cooperation,  namely (structural) realism, (neoliberal) institutionalism and (social) constructivism.
The most prominent argument coming out of (structural  or neo-)realism  holds that in  an  anarchical  environment  states  will  cooperate  on  the  basis  of a  common  threat,  more  precisely  when  facing  a  great  power,  by  balancing  against  it.16  In  line  with  balance  of  power  logic,  shifts  in  cooperative  behavior  are  expected  to  follow  shifts  in  the  distribution  of  power  in  the  international  system,  with  institutional  investments  thus  being  epiphenomena  of  the  balance  of  power  dynamic.
18  ‘power’  makes measuring the distribution of power notoriously difficult,  on the basis of  conventional  realist  indicators  such  as economic prosperity and  military capabilities the  US  was  the  strongest  player  coming  out  of  the  Second  World  War  and  was  also  recognized by  West German political  leaders as  such.17  Hence,  German  investment into  NATO  must  count  as  bandwagoning.
In  contrast to  balance  of power  proponents,  hegemonic  stability  that  smaller/weaker  states  may  bandwagon  because  they  benefit  from  the  greatest  power  maintaining  international  ‘stability’.
For  subsequent  periods  the  argument  might  be  that  German  governments  worried  about  a  possible  withdrawal of the American  ‘security umbrella’  expressed  in a waning US  commitment  to NATO.19 As discussed  in this thesis, the main empirical  problem this argument faces  ,7 See Walt (1987: 276ff); Ikenberry (2001:  168) and chapter eight.
Security  institutions  are  not  needed  to  provide  Germany with  economic leverage vis-a-vis the US.
And even  if Germany would be seen  as using  CFSP  to  strengthen  international  bodies  such  as  the  UN,  it  is  a  stretch  to  say  that  the  primary  reason  for doing so  would  be  to  constrain  the  US.
Despite  occasional  demands  in  Congress  to  reduce  US  troop  presence  in  Europe  and  the  US  hesitancy  to  intervene  in  Bosnia  in  the  early  1990s,  there  never  were  serious  plans  in  the  White  House  to  withdraw NATO’s  ‘security  umbrella’  from  Germany.
Yet the  main  problem  this approach faces is theoretical: not only is ‘stability’ too vague conceptually to qualify  as a common security interest, moreover it is  logically impossible to formulate opposing  arguments  (balancing/bandwagoning)  out  of  the  same  realist  paradigm  (Legro  and  Moravcsik  1999; see also chapter three).
Institutionalism,  by  definition,  pays  considerable  attention  to  international  institutions.
They  are  seen  as  valuable  providers  of  information  which  alleviate  the  security-  and  collective  action  dilemmas  arising  among  states  in  an  anarchical  setting  by creating  an  environment  in  which  credible  commitments  between  states  become  feasible.20  The  attractiveness/value of an  institution  depends  on  its efficiency to perform this task.
Hence,  while  it  is  useful  to  explain  how  institutions  enable  states to  pursue  these  interests  more  effectively,  the  theory  is  indeterminate  about  what  makes  a  ‘common  security  interest’.21  It  thus  offers  little  theoretical  traction  as  to  what  leads  Bonn  and  Washington to invest in NATO together other than  labeling  it (ex-post) as the  ‘rational’  thing to do.
Furthermore, German  investment in  CSCE (and  then  CFSP) would  only  be  explicable  if  it  could  be  shown  that  NATO  (and  then  CSCE)  were  ‘inefficient’  in  addressing  German  security  interests.
22 For a historical  institutionalist analysis of cooperation  in  European foreign  and  security  policy  more generally displaying the path-dependency bias, see Smith (2004).
20  Finally, the (social) constructivist approach,  in overlap with sociological  institutionalism  and  writings  on  security  communities,  emphasizes  the  influence  of  institutions  in  shaping  identities  and,  subsequently,  interests  of its  members.23  It puts  emphasis on  the  phenomenon  of  ‘socialization’  and,  crudely  speaking,  explains  cooperation  with  the  existence of a shared (‘collective’) identity embedded in common institutions.
It suggests that  if only  states  interact long  enough  and  within  the  right  institutions,  they  will  increasingly  ‘internalize’  collective  norms around which shared  identities revolve and, thus, progress towards an ever closer  union.
The  first response would be to take one  of the theories  and  adjust  it/the evidence  in  a  way  that  makes  an  existing  theory  ‘work’.
In  other  words,  it  aims  at  a  new  theory  of security  cooperation  which  can  make  sense  of the  phenomenon  at  hand.
Thus,  following the  point  made previously,  the  thesis  begins the theory  building enterprise at the level where the conception o f ‘security interests’ comes to rest.
In effect, this requires engaging questions of ontology, starting with  a conceptualization  of the  state.
Theory  understood  in  this  way  serves  as  preparation  for  ‘unravelling’  the  three  paradigms  outlined  earlier  (realism,  institutionalism, constructivism), that  is,  it provides a roadmap for carving out  core  insights as well as exposing conceptual tensions which can be carried forward for a  new theory of security cooperation.
The  case  study  in  the  second  half of the  thesis  has  a  dual  purpose.28  While  its  main  function  is to shed  light on the phenomenon of German-American cooperation,  it is also  of exploratory  nature  intended  to  trace  and  refine  the  causal  pathways  of the  theory  developed  in the first part of the thesis (Gerring 2007:  40ff).
Indeed,  the  ‘bias’  is  inevitable,  as  instead  of collecting  empirical  data  for  the  purpose  of  validation  or  refutation,  the  phenomenon  of  German-American  relations  serves as both  inspiration and  playground for the new theoretical  frame developed here.
Grasping  how  actors  interpret  their  world  is  challenging  because  it  requires  analyzing  the  influence of ideas or  ‘worldviews’.32  The  question  how  ideas and  values  can  shown  to  be  formative  forces  opens  up  the  ‘problem  of other  minds’  well  familiar  to  social  scientists and philosophers.33 There are three ways to address this problem.
As Ted Hopf puts it “the meaning of an  individual’s action and words  are  not  his  to  control  or  interpret”  but  must be  “surfaced  by  the  observer”  (Hopf 2007:  62f.
This  not  only  requires  empathy  to  see  the  world  from  the  perspective  of the  research  ‘object’  (rather:  subject),  ideally as a participant-observer (Klotz and Lynch 2007:  37),35 but also  reflexivity on the side of the analyst to allow awareness of its own biases when engaging  this task (Guzzini 2000; Tickner 2005).
It builds  on  the view that meaning is  constructed  not  in  isolation  but  in  a  social  setting  and  thereby  turns  into  a  ‘social  fact’  situated  between  and  across  the  minds  of  individuals  and  visible  in  social  practice.
Vincent  Pouliot’s  (2007:  367)  suggestion  that  contextualization  and  historicity  ‘objectify’  knowledge  because  they  require  the  analyst  to  ‘stand  back’  from  and  go  beyond  purely  subjective  and  current  meanings  is  useful  for  gaining  perspective,  but  not  sufficient  as  they  do  not  provide  the  analyst  with  guidance  on  which  context  and  which  history  matters  (and  why).
3) where the same sub-questions are “asked of each case under study to guide  and  standardize  data collection”  and with the  analyst dealing “only with  certain  aspects  of  the  historical  cases  examined”  (George  and  Bennett  2004:  67).
First,  ideally a case  study draws on  a variety of sources and,  in particular,  on  primary sources  gained  through  careful  archival  work  (historical  analysis  obviously  does  not  allow  a  participant-observation  approach).
This  is justified  by (i) the  focus on theory development, (ii) the temporal scope of the analysis and  by (iii) the fact  that  the  analysis  gains  its  explanatory  power  through  the  theoretical  argument.37  That  said,  one  problem  remains with  ‘second  order’  interpretation:  If all  secondary  literature  is  written  from  a  perspective,  the  empirical  narrative  may  rely  on  evidence taken  from  work whose interpretations do not coincide with the angle taken here.
Said differently,  it  runs  the  risk  of  ‘cherry  picking’  evidence  from  studies  whose  argumentative  thrust  is  different  from,  perhaps  even  in  conflict  with,  the  argument  presented  here.38  While  ideally  one  would  point  out  the  differences  and  clarity  contrasting  angles  wherever  possible,  given  the  vast  amount  of studies  done  on  German-American  relations  laying  out all the instances where my interpretation diverges from the studies referenced  in this  thesis  would  require  more  space  and  disrupt the  flow  of the  narrative.
Hence,  I  merely  36  In Gerring’s terminology, the  case  study  presented here  is a diachronic single-case study, that  is, it analyses a single case which contains internal temporal variation (Gerring 2007: 28).
37  Relying  on  secondary  sources  is  common  practice  among  social  scientists  working  with  a  broad  historical  horizon.
Finally,  coming  up  with  a  new/original  theoretical  angle  faces  a  semantic  challenge,  namely that  one  has  to  be  careful  with  using  established  terms  like  the  state,  security,  power,  etc.,  as  their  meaning  is  always  tied  to  a  broader  theoretical  frame.
This  concerns,  in  particular,  the  meaning  of security  policy,  which  for  most  scholars  writing  during  or  about  the  Cold  War  concerns  strategic-military  issues.
Rather  than  engaging  this  kind  of thinking,  the  thesis  contrasts  the  view  that  German-American  security  cooperation  was  based  primarily  on  a  military  rationale,  namely  deterring  a  Soviet  attack,  and  instead  strengthens  the  view  that  throughout  “Bonn’s  demand  for  security was primarily political in nature” (Doering-Manteuffel  1983:  52).
It  argues  that  a  persuasive  argument  requires  a  strong theoretical  foundation  and  reviews  the  positions  of Kuhn,  Popper,  and  Lakatos  to  adopt  the  latters’  notion  of a  ‘research  programme’  revolving  around  a  ‘hard  core’  and  the  notion  that  a  new  theory  is  ‘better’  if  it  can  27  produce and accommodating ‘novel facts’.
Noting that Lakatos remains vague about the  use  of these  terms  and  does  not  say  much  about  the  task  of theory  development,  the  discussion  justifies  a  deductive  approach  and  suggests  that  the  intellectual  space  for  theory building is opened via an exploration of the theoretical  limits of existing theories  (‘unravelling’).
The  chapter  closes  by  showing  how  such  an  account  operates  on  the  level  of ontology  and  gives  meaning  to  the  ‘national  security  interest’  via  an  understanding  of statehood  and  the  corresponding ‘existential threat’ to the same.
C hapter  Three  unravels  the  three  major  ‘paradigms’  -   realism,  institutionalism,  and  constructivism -  to (i) reveal both internal tensions and explore why they do not provide  a  convincing  causal  narrative  for  the  phenomenon  at  hand,  and  to  (ii)  use  them  as  a  source  of inspiration  for  ‘creative  theorizing’,  that  is,  to  learn  from  their  insights  and  limits.
interdependence  offers   their  focus  on   C hapter  Four  relies  on  Heidegger  to  argue  that  humans  are  driven  by  the  desire  to  control  anxiety.
Two  strategies,  mathematical  measuring and  routine  practices,  are  criticized  with  Heidegger for failing  to  provide  the  Self with  ‘authenticity’,  generating  an  ‘anxiety  dilemma’.
It  shows  how  IR  scholarship  has  neglected  looking  at  intimate  relations as stabilizing the Self by either focusing on the negative Other (‘the enemy’) or  vague notions of group  membership (‘community’).
More precisely,  it argues that states do so when the existing institutional arrangement ceases to  function  as an  anxiety controlling mechanism, that  is,  when  it ceases to  be the  platform  through  which  a  coherent  national  biography  can  be  negotiated  with  the  friend.
The  third  part  the  values  of   30  demonstrates  the  German-American  consensus  in  the  debate  over  German  rearmament  as  an  attempt  by  Adenauer  to  secure  German  voice  in  the  Western  project  through  NATO  membership.
The chapter shows that while the ‘Harmel  report’  and  the  ambiguous  meaning  of  detente  allowed  the  Brandt  government  to  formally  pursue  his  vision  it  considered  a  European  Security  Conference  (later  CSCE)  the  more  suitable  forum  for  building  ‘Germany-in-Greater-  Europe’.
It addresses the divergence  in  German-American  security cooperation  in  the  decade  between  1985  and  1995,  when  Bonn  came  to  invest  in  WEU/CFSP  as  an  alternative  to  NATO  and  CSCE.
C hapter Eleven  concludes by  summarizing the  main theoretical  and  empirical  insights  and  assesses  the  implications  for  IR theory  as  well  as  German-American  relations  and,  by extension, the institutionalization o f ‘European security’.
It  allows  to  ‘unravel’  existing IR theories from within not only to  lay out why they are unsuitable to  make sense of the phenomenon at hand but also,  and perhaps even more so, to use their  internal tensions and shortcomings as a stimulus for building a new theoretical frame.
The discussion  developing these  points  proceeds  as  follows:  It begins  by  laying out the  difference  between  shallow  and  deep  theorizing.
It  then  presents  a  reading  of the  ‘hard  core’  of a  theory  as  an  account  of the  human  condition  (as  opposed  to  human  nature)  in  which  the  meaning  of the  state  and  of  its  ‘national  security  interest’  is  embedded.
The  final  section justifies  this  ‘deep’  approach  with the  ‘survival’  assumption  popular  in  IR,  pointing out that  knowing what  it  means  for states to ‘survive’ requires an account of what it means for the state to ‘be’.
Although  the  ambition  to  present  an  accurate  picture  of the  past  necessarily  pervades  the  work  of  historians,  since  the  beginning  of  the  20th  century  scholars have come to admit that the historical  ‘record’  does not speak for itself.
In  this  dialogue,  which  for  those  aiming  at  prediction  also  includes  the  future,  theory  plays  the  crucial  role  of  categorizing  and  ordering  the  ‘record’.
Hans  Morgenthau,  who  believed  that  33  there  was  an  ‘’’intrinsic  nature”  of international  politics  and  in  the  ability  of theory  to  capture the  same “as  it actually  is”  (Morgenthau  1960:  15),  saw theory  function “like  a  skeleton  which,  invisible  from  the  naked  eye,  gives  form  and  function  to  the  body  [of  history]”  (in  Thompson,  1960:  18).
34  discipline  [of political  science]  since  its  origins”.43  While  the  scale  characterized  by  poles  of ‘soft’  and  ‘hard’  may  be  useful  for  debating  types/kinds  of science,  it  is  less  useful  for  the  task  of grasping  different  understandings  of theory  aimed  at  organizing  ‘history’  and,  thus,  lending  meaning  to  the  world.
theory   that   international   that  political   Taking a ‘Deep’ Look at Theory is  “whatever  philosophers  When  Sabine  (1969:  8)  notes  have...called  by  that  name”  he  suggests  that  theorising  is  the  domain  of philosophers.
John  Vasquez’s (1995)  point  that  not  everything  that  calls  itself such  is  a  theory  echoes  a  complaint  voiced by the  likes of Raymond Aron  (1967) and Kenneth  Waltz (1979),  both  of whom  noted  that  ‘theory’  is  an  over-used  and  abused  term  among  scholars  of  international  politics.
35  purpose  and  character  of ‘theory’  has  created  a  situation  where  scholars  “do  not agree  about  what  they  are  actually  doing  when  they  theorize  about  international  relations”  (Burchill,  2001:  8,  emphasis  added).44  In  short,  while  much  energy  has  been  spent  on  discussing  what  makes  a  theory  of  international politics',  few  have  focussed  on  the  question what makes a theory.45  Looking at Lakatos In  approaching this question  and clarifying the  meaning of ‘deep theory’,  it  is  useful to  briefly review the debate between Thomas Kuhn (1996  [1962]), Karl Popper (1968), and  Imre  Lakatos  (1970).
Although Wight/Bull’s taxonomy is useful for pointing to different ontologies of the international  and has  since been  further developed and  incorporated  into  more  sophisticated arguments,  most  notably  Wendt  (1999)  and  Buzan  (2004),  the  English  School  is  a  prime  example  for  an  ‘approach’  considered  both  grand  theory  (Buzan,  2004)  and  not  theory  at  all  (Waltz,  1998).
To be  clear, this is not to suggest that the work of Popper is philosophically shallow but, rather,  that  most  IR  research  adopting  a  positivist  approach  to  deal  with  the  interpretative  dilemma reduces the meaning of theory to a hypothesis of the kind  ‘if A then B’.
The  ironic  consequence  of  this  shallow  understanding  of  theory  is  that  it  requires  dismissing  one  of  the  most  important  IR  theories  dealing  with  security  cooperation,  47 As Klaus von Beyme (1992) reminds, Popper was no strict empiricist.
48  Although  it  appears  that  these  ‘paradigms’  manage  to  exist  side  by  side,  occasionally  even  feeding  off and  modifying  each  other.
In  his  words,  “conceptual  frameworks  can  be  developed  and  also  replaced  by  new  ones;  it  is  we  who  create  our prisons  and  we  can  also,  critically,  demolish them”  (Lakatos,  1970:  104).52  Furthermore,  in  a  move  away  from  Popper,53  for  Lakatos  criticism  needs  to  be  constructive;  there  can  be  no  falsification  before  the  emergence  of a  better  theory  as  “refutation  without  alternatives  shows  nothing  but  the  poverty  of  our  imagination”  (Lakatos,  1970:  120, Fn).
From  this  he  posits  that  the  criteria  for  evaluating  the  quality  of a  research  programme  -   whether  it  is  progressive  or  degenerative  -   lies  in  its  ability  to  provide  ‘auxiliary  hypotheses’  which  can  anticipate  and  adjust  to  ‘novel  facts’  (maintaining  external  consistency)  without  loosing  connection  to  the  ‘hard  core’  (maintaining  internal  consistency).
In  crude  terms,  one  could  say  the  Lakatosian  approach  is  twofold:  (1)  it  calls  for  assessing  ‘theories’  for internal (logical) and external (empirical) consistency  in coming  to terms with  ‘novel  facts’  and  (2)  it requires  constructive  criticism  by  holding that the  only  valid  rejection  of existing  theories  is  the  presentation  of a  better  theory  able  to  accommodate the  ‘novel  fact’.54  Although,  like  Kuhn  and  Popper,  Lakatos  is  primarily  interested  in  discussing  the  possibility  of  scientific  progress,  for  the  present  purpose  these two elements contain useful insights.
Delineating a research programme inevitably  violates the richness and complexity of individual thinkers and requires recognizing that  54  Here my reading differs  from  Vasquez (1997) who  imports a Popperian  falsifiability test into  Lakatos  (to  criticize  Waltzian  realism),  which  is  precisely  what  Lakatos  argued  against.
A  decision  for  the  former  requires  a  delineation  of  the  ‘hard  core’  grounding  the  research  programme.
Kenneth Waltz (1979) is one of the few IR theorists offering some thoughts  on the process of theory development.
As  noted  at  the  outset  of this  chapter,  both  inevitably  inform  our understanding  of the  world;  theory  is  always  inspired  by the  socio-political  context  and  could  not  be  built  without  abstract  reasoning.
We  seek  inspiration  from  ‘history’  through  ‘unscientific’  impressions  from  personal  experiences  as  well  as  by  systematically  acquiring  information,  often  second  hand,  through  careful  observation.57  Yet the usefulness of the inductive approach meets its limits in the interpretative bias.
Yet their manual  for ‘theory development’, written  largely in juxtaposition to King et al.
If the  best  strategy  is  to  somehow  combine  inductive  and  deductive  approaches,  the  question  is  what  this  means  in  practice.
Waltz  captures  taking  historical  observations/experiences   In  other  words,  while   41  this by saying that theories are “artistic creations”, that they require “creative ideas” and  the flashing of a “brilliant intuition” (Ibid., 9), yet he also concedes that one cannot say  much  beyond  the  fact  that  theories  are  made  ‘creatively’:  “Even  by  those  who  have  authored  them,  the  emergence  of theories  cannot  be  described  in  other  than  uncertain  and impressionistic ways” (Ibid.,  10).
Without  denying  that  reflections  are  informed by (learning more about) the empirical phenomenon, the approach of ‘creative  theorizing’ advanced here takes place in two steps.
The  first  step  is  to  seek  inspiration  from  existing  theories,  more  precisely  from  their  limits and  internal tensions.
inadequate   Applied  to  the  case  at  hand,  this  requires  engaging the  logical  thrust  of theories  at the  centre  of  the  three  dominant  research  programmes  in  IR  -   (neo)realism,  (liberal)  institutionalism, and (social) constructivism -  which cannot fully explain the emergence  and  demise  of the  German-American  security  cooperation  as  defined  here.
An  unravelling  approach  requires  ignoring  the  claim  made  by  some  that  the  hard  core  is  ‘privileged knowledge’  not to be challenged directly (Elman and Fendius Elman,  1997),  which  echoes  Waltz’  repeated  claim  that  one  cannot  criticize  (his)  assumptions.
This  point  is  arrived  at  by  tracing  arguments  over  what  makes  a  theory  internally  persuasive.
43  theory  is  internal  consistency,  or logical  coherence,  of the  argumentative chain.
Causality  of this  kind  informs  David  Boucher’s  suggestion  that  a  theory  imaginative  attempt  to  formulate  principles  and  incorporate  them  into  systematic  order  “directed not  so  much  to  the  resolution  of the  particular problems out of which they arose, but primarily to the place o f those problems  generally  in  the  human predicament”  (Boucher  1998:  10.  emphasis  added).
By  contrast,  an  account  of the  human  condition  requires  a  more  context-sensitive approach.
They  argue  that  research  must  focus  on  structures  or  processes  attributing  meaning  to  interests/motives/goals  and  suggest  that  these  ‘constitutive’  forces  operate  in  an  intersubjective  manner  which  cannot  be  grasped  linear/unidirectional  understanding of relationships but require a hermeneutical approach.63  through   60  See  Freyberg-Inan  (2004);  Doyle  (1997);  See  also  the  symposium  on  ‘The  Return  of Human  Nature  in  IR  Theory’  in  the  Journal  of International Relations  and Development  vol.
45  Whereas  for  Steve  Smith  these  two  approaches  rest  on  different  meta-theoretical  positions  which  require  “radically different types  of theory”  (Smith  1995:  27),  scholars  like  Wendt  argue  that  they  should  be  seen  as  applying  to  different  stages  of  the  argumentative chain,  addressing what  others  settle  on  the  level  of assumptions  without  abandoning the idea of doing causal  or explanatory research (Wendt,  1998,  1999).64 The  perspective  advanced  here  falls  somewhere  in  between.
It lies at the heart of one of the most influential conceptual frames in the study  of  international  politics,  namely  the  (neorealist)  conception  of  international  anarchy.
46  suffices to  point out that realist thinking about the  ‘condition’  of interstate relations has  significant  impact  on  their  understanding  what  international  politics  is  all  about  The  fundamental  distinction  realists  make  between  a  theory  about  relations  between  states  and  a  theory  concerned  with  domestic  order  or,  as  Martin  Wight  puts  it,  “speculation  about  the  state”  (Wight,  1966:  17),  rests  on  the  view  that  these  two  settings  are  characterized  by  two  different  ‘conditions’.
As  Wight  put  it,  whereas  in  the  domestic realm  scholars  can  apply “the theory of the good  life”  international theory must be “the theory of survival”  (Ibid., 33).
This distinction between  ‘domestic’  and  ‘international’  also underlies Waltz’  claim  that  there  is  a  difference  between  foreign  policy  analysis  and  a  theory  of  international  politics,  which  spurred  the  view  that  the  latter  is  not  concerned  with  explaining  motives  (Waltz  1979  in  Keohane  1986:  12If;  Elman  1996;  Zakaria  1998:  14).68  These  claims  actually  sell  short  the  depth  of realist theorizing  and  are  misleading  (see  chapter  three).
And as suggested below,  it anchors the causal narrative on the level  of the ontology of the  state,  which  is  another way to  say that discerning the  ‘condition’  states find themselves in inevitably requires ‘speculation about the state’.
The Parameters of the ‘National (Security) Interest’ The  introduction  laid out that an  explanation of why states cooperate and cease to do  so  must give meaning to the  ‘common  interest’  or,  more precisely, a shared  self-interest.
More  precisely,  what  are  the  parameters  of the  national  68 As  Fareed Zakaria summarizes this  view,  a theory of foreign  policy  explains why  states  have  “different intentions”,  or  interests,  while a theory of international  politics explains “international  events”, or outcomes.
47  (security)  interest  governments  are  expected  to  pursue  (for  the  successful  pursuit  of  which they are held responsible/accountable) on the basis of which they make decisions  over investment in international (security) institutions?
Rather  than  splitting  the  ‘national  interest’  up  in  various  sectoral  understandings  of  ‘well  being’,  IR  scholars  in  an  attempt  to  pin  down  the  national security interest (which by definition is a ‘vital’  interest) tend to make use of the  human analogy and resort to Hobbes’ emphasis on self-preservation, or survival.
At least  since John Herz declared “let us think first of all  about how to  survive, thereafter about  everything else”  (Herz  1962:  3),  scholars  across the theoretical  spectrum  from  Wolfers  (1962)  and  Wight  (1966)  via  Waltz  (1979)  to  Wendt  (1999)  readily  translate  the  Hobbesian  assumption  of the  individual’s  ‘will’  for  self-preservation  into  the  realm  of  international  politics.
Even  more  sophisticated  attempts  to  provide  a  ‘new  framework’  for security analysis build on the  assumption that “security  is about survival” (Buzan  et  48  al.,  1998:  21),  and  it  certainly  appears  to  be  accepted  wisdom  among  scholars  dealing  with  the  phenomenon  of  security  cooperation  (Powell,  1994:  320f;  Stein  1990:  87f;  Levy, 2002:  131).70  The focus on self-preservation implies that security policy is, at bottom, about protecting  ‘the state’  from serious harm by preventing things from happening which endangers ‘its’  existence.
David Baldwin captures this by suggesting that the  ‘national  security interest’  is  formulated  on  the  basis  of two  components:  a  referent  object  (the  ‘state’)  and  an  existential  threat  as  something  (perceived  to  be)  capable  of  doing  harm  to  the  core  features  of the  former and  endangering  its  existence  (Baldwin  1997;  also  Buzan  1991;  Waever  et  al.,  1993).
Hence,  the  conceptualization  of the  state  is  crucial  because  it  informs the definition of the existential threat.
Said differently,  the  ‘national  security  interest’  only  becomes  intelligible  by  identifying  the  baseline  features  of the  state’s  existence  and  what  its vulnerabilities  are.
As  Barry  Buzan  points  out,  threats  and  vulnerabilities  are  intrinsically  linked  as  “only  when  one  has  a  reasonable  idea  of  both  the  nature  of  threats,  and  the  vulnerabilities  of  the  objects  towards  which  they  are  directed,  can  one  begin  to  make  sense  of  national  security”  (Buzan  1991:  112).
This  means  that,  logically  speaking,  a  causal  narrative  explaining  choices  made  in  the  name  of ‘national  security’  cannot  simply  stop  with  an  emphasis  on  ‘survival’  as  the  basic  interest.
Questions  of whether  and  how  to  differentiate  between  ‘subjective’  and  ‘objective’  accounts  of national  security  (Wolfers  1962:  150ff),  echoed  in  the  question  whether threat may be  misperceived (Jervis  1976),  and the debate  over the widening of  the meaning of security since the end of the Cold War suggest that state survival may be  interpreted  in  different  ways,  a crucial  point  made  by  Wolfers  some time ago  (Wolfers  1962:  73).71  Indeterminism about what it means for a state to survive  is also reflected  in  the  disagreement about the  occurrence  of state  ‘death’:  while  some  scholars  claim  that  “the  world...provides  a  historical  record  replete  with  examples  of countries  that  have  disappeared”  (Stein  1990:  87),  others  assert  that  “the  death  rate  among  states  is  remarkably  low”  (Waltz,  1979:  95;  also  Strang,  1991)  or  “almost  nil”  (Wendt  1999:  279).
71  On the contested meaning o f ‘security’, see Haftendom (1991); Buzan (1991); Baldwin (1997);  Huysmans (1998b); Williams (2003).
A  fragmentation  into  different government branches, interests groups, public opinion, media, courts, and so on  renders  ‘the  state’  too  complex  for  theorising  and  empty  of meaning  (Ringmar  1996:  449).
This  position  does  not  suggest  that  the  state  really  is  a  human  being/person  (indeed,  accepts  that  it  is  not)  but  argues  that  theories  attributing  assumptions  about  human  desires  to  the  state  can  provide  useful  models  for  making  sense  of international  politics.
72  See  also  Ringmar  (1996)  and  the  ‘Forum  on  the  State  as  a  Person’,  Review  of International  Studies 30, no.
50  The second position, put forward  by Alexander Wendt, argues that the state actually is a  person  or,  rather,  can  be  conceptualised  as  possessing  similar  properties  as  a  human  being,  including  an  organism,  motives  (cognitive  and  emotional)  and  a  consciousness  (Wendt  1999;  2004).
To  close  the  circle,  if a  deep  theory  perspective  focuses  on  how  the  national  security  interest  emerges  in  the  conceptualization  of ‘the  state’  and  the  ‘existential  threat’,  the  presence (or absence) of a common security interest depends on the degree to which the  two  are  shared.
In  other  words,  for  states  to  cooperate  in the  security  realm  they  must  perceive their existence as somehow interlinked/interdependent and agree on a common  (or shared) existential threat.
The  following  chapter will  discuss  how  the  dominant  research  programmes  in  IR  have  dealt  with  this  task  by  unravelling  their  causal  narratives on interstate security cooperation.
Although  the  writings  of  a  large  number  of  authors  inform the discussion,  for each (alleged) research  programme the conception  of  the  hard  core  is  illustrated through the writings  of key representatives,  namely Kenneth  Waltz  and  Alexander  Wendt  (constructivism).
(realism),  Robert  Keohane   (institutionalism)   (I) Realism: Providing the Baseline Realism  is intrinsically connected to the origin of IR as a discipline in Western academia  -  Stefano Guzzini (1998) calls  it the “initial  paradigm” -  and,  although challenged time  and  again,  it  remains  the  dominant  research  programme  in  the  study  of  international  53  politics.74 William Wohlforth (2008) even claims that “it is only a slight exaggeration to  say that the academic study of international relations is a debate about realism”.
They  follow  Machiavelli  in  propagating  the  necessity  “to  accept  reality  unvarnished”  (Stein,  1990:  4)  and  “to  understand  international  politics  as  realist  Erkenntnisinteresse  is  to  identify  the  ‘true’  national  interest  and  with  it  the  ‘laws  of  politics’  determining interstate conflict and cooperation.
The   it  actually   is”   Since  the  foundational  writings  of  E.H.  Carr  (2001)  and  Hans  Morgenthau  (1960)  a  number  of  realist  ‘theories’  developed  and  generated  “different  worlds  of  realism”  (Guzzini  1998),75 which raises the question whether there still is a realist hard core.
In an  influential  critique,  Jeffrey  Legro  and  Andrew  Moravcsik  (1999)  argue  from  a  Lakatosian  perspective  that  ‘realism’  has  become  internally  incoherent.
It  is  at odds with parts of Germany cooperating with the US in NATO at a time where the US  was the strongest power in the system (period one), it cannot explain German investment  in  CSCE  at  a  time  of  (perceived)  decline  in  US  power  (period  two),  or  German  investment  in  CFSP,  which  occurred  at  a  time  of  growing  US  power  yet  lacks  characteristics  of an  instrument for deterrence  and,  hence,  the  key qualities  of a  realist  balancing move (period three).77  The task of tracing the conceptual weakness of the balancing argument to the realist hard  core  it  makes  sense  to  start  with  the  four  basic  assumptions  generally  attributed  to  realism:78  (1)  states  are the principal  actors  in  international  politics,  (2)  states  behave as  rational  and  self-interested actors who (3) compete for power in  an  international  system  without  central  authority  (anarchy),  with  (4)  the  anarchic  character  of the  international  system  being  the  principal  force  shaping  (the  actions  of)  states.
As  the  first  two  assumptions  are  also  shared  by  other  paradigms  and  generic  for  a  theory  of interstate  security  cooperation,  the  uniquely  realist conception  of what makes a  ‘self interest’  lies  with the last two assumptions.
This  assumption  has  been  central  to  realist  attempts  to  make  sense  of international  politics  from  the  start.
Indeed, one  is hard  pressed to find an  IR scholar who would disagree with  Brian  Schmidt’s observation that “realists throughout the ages have argued that power is  the decisive determinant” in the relations among states, and that “all  realists characterise  international  politics  in terms of a continuous  struggle for power” (Schmidt 2007:  44f).
How  this  link  is  established  is  discussed  later;  for now  it suffices  to  say that the  basic  realist  assumption  is  that  states  77 On the empirical weaknesses of the neorealist balance-of-power argument more generally, see  Vasquez  (1995,  1997),  who  uses  a  Lakatosian  framework  and  relies  significantly  on  Paul  Schroeder’s (1994) work.
Indeed,  the  latter  leads  to  the  former,  that  is,  because  for  realists  “power...is  the  valid  and  complete  measure  of threat”  (Doyle  1997:  168)  states  are  assumed to want ‘power’ to ensure their security.
In  other  words, the  common  interest bringing states together is the determination to prevent any  (group  of)  state(s)  to  achieve  or maintain  a  dominant position  through  ‘internal’  and/or  ‘external’  balancing (Waltz  1979).
Alliances  are  thus  a  “necessary  function”  (Morgenthau  1960:  181)  and  an  “integral  part” (Levy,  2002)  of the  balance  of power dynamic and  security  cooperation  a  permanent  feature  of the  realist  understanding  of international  politics.81  States  may  institutionalise  their  alliance  for  coordination  purposes,  yet  because  they  don’t  like to  be  constrained  and  aim  at reducing  interdependence  (see  below)  they will  keep investments in common institutions at a minimum.82  According to the balancing logic, states will end the cooperative relationship when there  is  a  shift  in  the  distribution  of power,  that  is,  either  when  a  state  within  the  alliance  increases  its  relative  power or when  the  hegemon  experiences  a decrease  in  its  relative  power.
More precisely,  states will  cease to cooperate  if they expect a shift in  how gains  79  Realists  may  bridge  the  tension  between  saying  that  cooperation  is  difficult  to  achieve  and  implying that it occurs all the time by suggesting that it is a practical dilemma (Snyder 1997:  18).
81  Glenn  Snyder (1997)  provides  a  comprehensive  conceptual  discussion  of alliance  dynamics,  including the stage of bargaining omitted here.
One  notable  attempt  to  come  to  terms  with  ‘bandwagoning’  is  presented  by  Stephen  Walt,  who  tries  to  turn  it  into  a  rational  decision  within  a  balancing  framework  by  arguing  that  states  do  not  balance  power  but  threats.88  More  precisely,  he  holds  that  83  Echoing  George  Liska  (1962:  193)  that  “increases  in  alternatives  available  contribute  to  realignment and alliance dissolution”, Waltz argues that bipolarity is more stable because smaller  states  have  no  viable  alternative,  whereas  in  a  multipolar  world  an  alliance  “unskillfully  managed”  may  fall  apart more easily (Waltz  1979:  170).
What makes  ‘(un)skilful  management’  remains unclear.
87  As  Holsti  et  al  (1973:  6)  write,  the  balance  of power  proposition  “requires  that  statesmen  adhere to  certain  rules,  one  of the  most  important  of which  is  that they  must  form  alliances  to  prevent any nation...from achieving a position of hegemony.
Yet  decoupling  regional  power  estimates  from  the  international  system  or  57  states feel threatened not simply by relative military capabilities but by a combination of  (i)  aggregate  power,  (ii)  geographic  proximity,  (iii)  offensive  military  capabilities,  and  (iv)  aggressive  intentions.
89 Walt’s note that ideology only  affects the choice of allies when states feel  secure already, that  is,  “face  no  significant  external  threat”  (1987:  217)  is  inconsistent  with  his  argument  that  ideology may be part of the threat (Ibid).
58  An  issue not directly addressed by either Walt or Schweller, yet which  is at the heart of  the  realist  conundrum  why  some  states  do  not  ‘answer’  great power threats  in  the  way  balancing  logic  dictates,  is  the  question  of  how  to  actually  measure  power.
Hence,  it  requires  going  beyond  the  view  that  humans  have  a  natural  desire  for  power  often  attributed  to  realists  and  traced  to  Machiavelli  (Boucher  1998:  93f.
In short, when Morgenthau  claims  that  “whatever  the  ultimate  aims  of international  politics,  power  is  always  the  immediate aim” (Morgenthau  1946:  13), he leaves open what this  ‘ultimate aim’  is.
On  the  question  how  states turn  from  a  ‘survival-seeker’  into  a  ‘power-seeker’,  realists  point to  international  anarchy  (see  assumption  (4)  above)  which,  as  is  well  known,  realists  adopt  from  the  ‘state  of  nature’  image  provided  by  Hobbes  (Waltz  2001;  1979;  2000;  Mearsheimer  2001).
);  Beitz  (1999:  60  While  for  most  IR  scholars  the  ‘condition’  of anarchy  is  expressed  in  the  distinction  between a vertical (hierarchical) organization of the  legitimate use of force within  states  and a horizontal (’anarchical’) organization among states, the reading here emphasizes a  different  angle.
61  law-enforcement  (Morgenthau,  1960:  312ff).101  Similarly,   discussing  the  meaning  of  sovereignty,  who  defines  it  as  ‘supreme  authority’  in  the  realm  of  for  Waltz,  sovereignty  is  about  “being  able  to  decide  for  itself  how  to  cope  with  internal  and  external problems” (Waltz,  1979: 95).
He  acknowledged  that  dependence  of some  states  on  others  in  military,  economic,  or technological  matters  makes  it  difficult,  or  even  impossible,  for  them  to  pursue  independent  domestic  and  foreign  policies.
Instead,  realists  emphasize  territoriality  and  make  control  over/possession  of  an  exclusive  territory  the  central  feature  of the  spatial  configuration  of the  state  (Hobson  2000:  56ff;  Ruggie,  1993).
Carr,  while  acknowledging  that  the  “most  comprehensive  power  units”  in  international  politics  must  not  necessarily  be  territorially  organized,  notes that the modem state clearly is based on “territorial sovereignty” (Carr 2001:  210).
The elasticity of the meaning of ‘sovereignty’  102  Waltz’  note that “states  seek  to  control  what they  depend  on  or to  lessen  the  extent of their  dependency”  (Waltz,  1979:  106;  Waltz,  1986:  324)  echoes  the  classification  of states  as  either  ‘satisfied’  or ‘dissatisfied’  (Carr 2001; Morgenthau  1960;  Wolfers,  1962) and also permeates the  debate  between  ‘defensive’  and  ‘offensive’  realism  and  its  emphasis  on  ‘status  quo’  and  ‘revisionist’  states,  respectively.
He  invokes  Durkheim’s  insight that groups  establish  norms of behaviour which members conform to (Waltz  1979:  75), remaining quiet about  where  these  norms  come  from  other  than  vaguely  suggesting  that  “the  persistent  characteristics  of  group  behaviour  result  in  part  from  the  qualities  of  its  members”  (Waltz  1979:  76).
Supplementing  this  rudimentary  socialization  dynamic  with  microeconomic logic, Waltz translates the market analogy that “competitive systems are  regulated...by the rationality of the more successful competitors” (Waltz  1979:  76) to IR  and  suggests that states  will  conform  to  successful  practices  of the most powerful  state  and that “those who not...will fail to prosper, will lay themselves to dangers, will suffer”  103 This point is made by Morgenthau.
This can take place in two possible ways, namely (i) by giving the other  nation  veto-power  from  the  outside  or  (ii)  through  the  physical  violation  of territorial  integrity  which “places the agents of B  above A in terms of lawgiving and -enforcing”,  in other words by  taking  physical  control  of the  authority  structure  through  occupation  (Morgenthau  1960:  322).
64  Waltz  1979:  118).104  His  notion that  international  structure  “molds agents”  and  thereby  “causes”  states to  be  alike  by  encouraging  “similarities  of attributes  and  of behaviour”  (Waltz  1979:  74,  76)  blends socialization and competition to some kind of casual force,  but  it  also  involves  reflective  activity  on  the  side  of states.
4),  and  while  the  condition  of anarchy  encourages  the  practice  of balancing  (see  below), there  is no compelling  logic  in the realist narrative which  suggests that anarchy  conditions  states to  be  autonomous,  or desire  autonomy/territorial  integrity.
65  abstraction  from  a  number of individuals  who  have  certain  characteristics  in  common”  (Morgenthau  1960:  101) and  suggests that there  is  an  inverse relationship  between  “the  emotional  intensity  of  the  identification  of  the  individual  with  his  nation”  and  the  stability  and  sense  of  security  within  a  society  (Ibid.,  106).
Gilpin  (1981:  14f)  notes the close  link  between  realist  state-centrism  and  nationalism  and  Mearsheimer  (1990:  18ff  in  Brown),  mentions  nationalism  as  beliefs  of uniqueness  and  pride  “which  hold  that  a  nation  should  have  its  own  state”  and  calls  it  a  “second  order  force  in  international  politics”  (Ibid.,  19;  see  also  Posen  1993).
Buzan’s  conceptualization  of  the  state  primarily  as  a  “binding  idea”  or  “organizing  ideology”  provides  the  most  elaborate  discussion among realists of the meaning of ‘national’ security (Buzan  1991: 64,  72-82).
Regardless  of what the  interests of state Y are today, even  in a state of full transparency and perfect  information  state  X  cannot  know  what  Y ’s  interests  will  be  like  tomorrow  and,  consequently, what state Y might do with the military capabilities at its disposal (indeed,  Y in all likelihood does not know for certain, either).
to   The  concern  that  today’s  friend  might  be  tomorrow’s  enemy  informs  Joseph  Grieco’s  well-known  argument that  states  worry  about  ‘relative  gains’,  which  he  identifies  as  a  central  feature of realist logic.
In Grieco’s words, because states are unable to predict or  readily  to  control  the  future  interest  of  partners,  and  hence  are  “uncertain  about  on  another’s future  intentions...they  pay  close  attention  to  how  cooperation  might  affect  relative capabilities  in  the future  (Grieco,  1990:  45,  emphasis  in  original).
Herz  famously  captured  the  tragic  consequence  of this  distrust  in  the  notion  of the  security  dilemma  where  uncertainty  turns  relations  among  states  striving  for  self-preservation  into  a  competition  for  military  power  (Herz  1951;  Jervis,  1978,  1988;  Booth  and  Wheeler 2008).
By  contrast,  defensive  realists  argue that  states  are  aware  of the  potential  danger  of the  spiral  triggered  by  the  security  dilemma  and  hesitant  to  ever increase their capabilities (Jervis  1999:  4;  Waltz  1979:  126).
Indeed, they hold that  the  security  dilemma  can  be  eased  by  arguing  that  states  can  make  the  future  more  predictable  by  taking  into  account  what  Taliaferro  (2000)  has  called  “structural  modifiers”,  such  as  geography,  signalled  intentions  and/or reciprocal  behaviour.
In  sum,  in  the  realist  narrative  the  national  security  interest  forming  in  ‘anarchy’  is  constituted to a significant degree  in time,  relying of a particular knowledge of the  past  (as one where conflict arose out of an  imbalance of ‘power’) projected  into an uncertain  future  (entertaining  corresponding  worst-case  scenarios  which  depict  great  powers  as  threatening).
(II)  Institutionalism: Adjusting Realism The institutionalist argument was originally developed to explain phenomena in political  economy and attempts to explain cooperation in the security realm are relatively new.111  The  label  of  ‘Institutionalism’  also  encompasses  a  variety  of approaches  which  often  have not much more in common than  emphasizing that  ‘institutions matter’  in the study  110 Carr (2001: 4f) was quite explicit about the emancipatory purposes of theorizing.
70  of  international  politics.112  Here  it  is  sufficient  to  distinguish  between  two  strands,  historical  institutionalism  and  neoliberal  institutionalism.
Developed  originally  by  Ernst  Haas  (1958,  1964),  it  suggests  that  shared  institutions  established  in  core  sectors  will  gradually take on  a  life  on their own  and  push  forward  an  integrative  dynamic through  unintended  ‘spill-over’  processes.113  Historical  institutionalism  adopts  this  emphasis  on  the  evolutionary,  indeed  progressive  character  of institutions,114  and  some  even  stress  socialising  effects  of  institutions  on  their  members  (‘sociological  institutionalism’).115  The  shared  baseline  of historical  institutionalism  is  a causal  narrative  which  contains  a  strong  bias  towards  path  dependency  by  emphasizing  that  institutions  or,  rather,  the  trajectory of their development, are  ‘locked in’  at a certain point in time and then unfold  from thereon  in a certain direction.
These  turning  points,  also  called  ‘historical  junctures’  or  ‘critical  moments’,  open  up  space  for  agency,  indeed  are  defined  by  the  very  fact  that  agents  are  able  to  influence  the  direction  of institutional  development (e.g.,  Katznelson  2003).
This does not  fit with the process-perspective taken here which emphasizes gradual change over a long  period of time.116  Neoliberal Institutionalism: Limits and Openings As  the  name  suggests,  neoliberal  institutionalism  is  a  mix  of  regime  theory  and  neoliberal  reasoning  developed  most  coherently  by  Robert  Keohane.117  In  contrast  to  historical  institutionalism  it gives continuous prominence to state agency.
Emerging out  of  the  work  he  did  with  Joseph  Nye  on  the  impact  of  economic  interdependence  (Keohane  and  Nye  1989),  Keohane  challenges  the  realist  view  of the  irrelevance  of  116 For a discussion and critique of the analytical value o f ‘historical junctures’, see Capoccia and  Kelemen (2007).
"8  In  managing interdependence institutions are neither irrelevant nor simply constraining but  are  enabling  by  allowing  states  to  cooperate  for  mutual  benefit.
The  argument  is  that,  once  common  interest are known to exist which can be ‘more efficiently’ pursued by working together,  states strive towards reaching a pareto-optimal  level of cooperation, that is, a level when  no  (known)  alternative  arrangement exists  that could  make  one  state  better off without  making the  other worse  off (Keohane,  1984:  51).119  To  achieve  this  level, they  will  set  up an institution whose primary function it is to reduce the transaction costs arising in an  anarchy,  mainly  costs  of coordination,  by  providing  ‘reliable  information’  about  each  other.
Thus,  institutions  are  said  to  be  able  to  alleviate  distrust  by  providing  an  environment in which credible commitments become feasible.120 The attractiveness of an  institution  depends  on  its  ability  to  fulfil  this  function,  that  is  on  its  efficiency  in  “improving  the  informational  environment”  by  providing  mechanisms  which  reduce  uncertainty (Keohane and Martin, 2003:  80).
120  Specifically,  institutions  address  the  risk  of  free-riding  and  cheating  (collective  action  dilemma),  as  well  as  mistrust  and  information  asymmetries  (security  dilemma),  obstacles  to  cooperation  identified  in  games  such  as  the  prisoners’  dilemma  (Jervis  1978).
An  evaluation of an  institutions’  efficiency comes down to the question whether it provides  sufficient  ‘information’  and  satisfies  the  states’  security  interests.
The  theory  does  not  specify the kind of ‘information’  the  institution must provide beyond the track record of  past compliance and projecting expected gains and  losses and a pareto-optimal situation.
While  some  may  see  indeterminacy  in  defining  security  interests  as  an  advantage  because  it  allows  institutionalism  to  be  more  flexible  in  defining  ‘security  interests’  depending  on  the  case  at  hand  (Haftendoren  et  al.
The  reason  institutionalism does not provide a unique reading of (security)  ‘interests’  is  because  it  does  not possess  a  distinctive  hard  core  but  relies  on  realist  ontology  of the  state as an  actor striving for autonomy in an anarchical  environment.
These transnational  linkages present the  international  as a space that  is  not  confined  to  the  ‘in-between’  state  borders  and,  thus,  changes  the  perspective  on  how states relate to each other spatially.
Picturing states not as closed  ‘units’  and borders  not  as  rigidly  separating  but  as  permeable  shifts  the  focus  of  the  spatial  dimension  towards the transnational  and towards how states manage this condition.
Loosely  defined  as  rules,  norms,  and  decision-making procedures,  institutions  are  not  merely  regulating  interdependence  but  are  providing  information  which reduces uncertainty and, consequently, tames anarchy (see also Krasner  1982).
In  an  overlap  with  ‘defensive  realists’,  institutions  are  thus  said  to  function  as  ‘structural  modifiers’  able to  increase  interstate trust by providing reliable  information  about each  other’s commitments, thereby changing the  ‘informational environment’ and making the  future  (somewhat)  more  predictable  (Jervis,  1999;  Keohane  and  Martin,  2003).
It  does  in  substantiating  the  ‘informational  environment’  on  the  temporal  dimension  and,  more  specifically,  does  not  address  the  root  of the  realist  (pessimist)  state of mind, namely that the  reading of the  future  is  based  on  a certain  reading of the  past as one of recurring conflict.
By  suggesting  that  if  only  states  interact  long  enough  and  within  an  institutionalized cooperative setting they will  internalize collective norms and  progress towards  an  ever closer union,  it contains  a path-dependency  bias  very  similar  to  that  of historical  institutionalism.
Rather,  as  part  of the  critical  turn  making  its  way  through  the  social  sciences  in  the  1980s, constructivism, alongside feminist and postcolonial approaches, emerged out of a  fundamental  dissatisfaction with  the ontology and  epistemology of the  realist-rationalist  mainstream.122  This  critical  move  was  stimulated  by  the  philosophical  Zeitgeist  of  postmodernism  and  the  contours  of the  constructivist  research  programme  developed  through the intellectual openings this Zeitgeist provided.
what  the  ‘post’  stands  for).123  In  broad  terms,  postmodernism designates “a reaction to the monotomy of universal modernism’s vision  of the world” as “positivistic, technocentric, and rationalistic” and marked by “the belief  in  linear  progress,  absolute  truths,  the  rational  planning  of ideal  social  orders,  and  the  standardization  of  knowledge”  (Harvey  1989:  9).
This  is  in  particular  the  case  for  scholars  engaging  with  security  issues  where,  in  line  with the  notion that “the  issue  of identity...is  inseparable  from  security”  (Booth,  1997:  88),  constructivists  have  come to  focus  on  state  ‘identity’  as  that  (referent  object/subject)  which  needs  to  be  secured.127  However,  as  discussed  below  in  more detail,  it rarely  is clear what exactly  identity  is, what  it does and  how to  study  it.
Note that as part of the ‘cultural turn’, these works tend to  argue that national  identity  is constituted by some sort o f ‘culture’ (strategic, political, military).
I  find the analytical  value of the culture concept questionable and it is omitted here and throughout  the thesis,  for a  simple  reason:  any  application  of ‘culture’  in  a  meaningful  way -  other than  a  vague  catch-all  concept -  requires  specification  of the  determinants  or parameters  making  up  a  ‘culture’, which constructivists suggest are norms and ideas.
Any  attempt to establish  a causal  narrative  in the deep theory sense  inevitably risks  stepping  into  the  ‘enlightenment  trap’,  that  is,  it  risks  claiming  a  higher  access  to  truth  and  thereby  becomes  part  of the  very  power/knowledge  nexus  the  radical  strand  seeks  to  undermine.
Hence, the  following focuses on the  ‘moderate’  strand  and  primarily on the  work of Wendt (1999; also  1992;  1994;  2003), which comes closest to presenting a deep  theory, as well as Adler and Barnett (1998) and Cronin (1999).
Specifically,  Wendt  argues  that  different  ‘political  cultures’  or  ‘logics  of  anarchy’  may  develop  between  states  which,  borrowing  English-school  typology,  he  describes as (i) a Hobbesian culture ruled by fear of war, where states see each other as  enemies, (ii) a Lockian culture regulated  by mutual respect for the  right of sovereignty,  where states considered each other rivals, and (iii) a Kantian culture in which states have  ruled  out  war  as  a  conflict-solving  tool  and  identify  each  other  as  friends.
6 and 7).132  This  argument resonates  with  the  one  by  Emanuel Adler and Michael  Barnett’s  (1998)  that  interstate  relations  undergo  an  evolutionary dynamic bringing them  from  ‘nascent’  to  ‘mature’  security communities  (Adler and  Barnett  1998:  48ff).
Building on  the  work  by  Karl  Deutsch,  Adler  and  Barnett  also  emphasise  the  creation  of shared  knowledge  through  ‘social  learning’  brought  about  by  increased  transactions  and  communication,  which  over  time  establishes  “’we  feeling’,  trust,  and  mutual  consideration”  through  “partial  identification  in  terms  of self-images  and  interests”  (Deutsch  et  al.
Adapting  the  institutionalist  perspective  outlined  earlier,  Adler  and  Barnett  see  institutions  as  providing  trust-enhancing  mechanisms,  as  sites  of  interaction  where  learning  occurs  and  as  creative  forces  through  which  states  develop  “dependable  expectations of peaceful  change”.
They also suggest that  ‘power’  plays a crucial  role  in  the  formation  of security  communities  with  a  ‘core  state’  serving  as  a  ‘magnet’,133  yet  apart  from  noting  that  such  power  is  exercised  via  “positive  images”  and  expectations  about  “benefits”  associated  with  the  community  they  don’t  elaborate  on  the  nature  of  131  See also Ruggie (1993); Reus-Smit (1998); Hall (1999).

Finally,  Bruce Cronin’s  (1999)  narrative,  which  falls  between  the  above  two,  offers  a  slightly  more  complex  typology  of six  different  security  arrangements ranging  from  one  where  cooperation  is  based  on  a  balance  of  power  logic,  expressing  interstate  relations  characterised  by  hostility,  to  a  highly  institutionalised  system  of  collective  security,  characterised  by  symbiosis (Cronin  1999,  Ch.
Adler and  Barnett (1998:  38)  mention a range  of  factors  leading  to  the  crucial  first  cooperative  agreement  from  which  security  communities  evolve.
137  Adler  and  Barnett  only  pay  lip  service  to  the  possible  ‘reversal’  of the  dynamic,  not  going  beyond the suggestion that “the same  forces that ‘build up’  security communities can  ‘tear them  down’”  leaving  the  reader  in  the  dark  as  to  how  exactly  this  is  supposed  to  work  (Adler  and  Barnett  1998: 58).
Constructivists  argue  that  ‘identity’  has  an  ‘internal’  (or  individual/personal/reflective)  and  an  ‘external’  (collective/social)  dimension.138  This  insight  is  taken  from  social  psychology  and  traceable  to  the  famous  distinction  between  ‘I’  and  ‘Me’  made  by  George  Herbert  Mead  (1934).
Mead  argues  that  Self-fulfilment takes  place  through  an  evolutionary  process  in  which  the  acting  Self,  the  ‘I’  driven  by  intuition  and  instinct,  comes to  internalize the  “attitude  of the whole community”,  devising the  sense of ‘Me’  gained  by  adapting  to  a  social  group  (Mead  1934).
The  difficulty  is,  however,  to  conceptualize  the  ‘internal’  and  the  ‘external’  dimension  and  their  relationship  beyond  asserting that they are ‘co-constituted’.
Scholars  who,  implicitly  or  explicitly,  treat  the  state  like  a  person  read  the  ‘internal’  somehow into the state and attribute the  ‘external’  or social/collective source of identity  to  some  notion  of international  ‘community’  or  ‘group’,  that  is,  they  remain  vague  on  how  to  conceptualize  the  ‘internal’  source  of a  states’  identity  and  specifying  (how  it  relates to) the ‘external’.
83  Yet  the  question  if and  how  the  T   has  any  influence  on  the  kind  of  ‘community’  or  ‘group’  from  which  the  social/collective  identity  is  obtained  is  a  crucial  one  for  the  constructivist  narrative,  as  choosing  to  cooperate  (or  not)  and,  thus,  to  conceptualise  change within cooperative relationships requires some sort of standard against which the  value  of  this  relationship  is  assessed.
For  a  causal  argument  explaining  change  in  external  relations,  it  thus  makes  sense  to  move  analytical  attention  to  the  ‘internal’  source o f ‘identity’.
While identities and interests  must to some degree be internally generated to provide the state with agency, addressing  this  ‘internal’  dimension/source is not easy.
Indeed, shunned by the anti-foundationalism  of  the  postmodern  Zeitgeist  and  neglected  by  the  structural  reasoning  of  a  neo-  Durkheimean ontology which assumes that all construction must be social,  it tends to be  ignored.139  To  his  credit,  Wendt tries  to  balance  the  ‘internal’  (or  personal)  and  the  ‘external’  (or  social)  dimension  of ‘identity’  and  keep  a  place  for agency.
In an attempt to offer an ontology which  integrates the  ‘internal’  (individualistic)  and the  ‘external’  (holistic),  Wendt conceptualises the  state  as an  entity possessing four  kinds of identities  (collective,  role,  type,  corporate).
Hence,  he  notes  that the  territorial  base  can  have  “fuzzy”  boundaries  and  whose  meaning  can  vary  and  that  states  may  include  others  “cognitively”,  thereby  making  territorial borders less  ‘rigid’  or exclusive (Ibid., 212, see also Cronin  1999:  21).
Yet the  core  of his ontology is society,  loosely defined  as “people with  shared  knowledge”, and  with  the  crucial  qualification  that  this  knowledge  is  “self  organizing”  (Wendt  1999:  209).
142  Wendt (1999:  201-214) discusses the following properties:  (i)  an  institutional-legal  order (ii)  an  organization  claiming  a  monopoly  on  the  legitimate  use  of  organized  violence,  (iii)  an  organization with sovereignty, (iv) a society and (v) territory.
Against  the  view  that  understanding  oneself  as  unique and distinct requires a social  setting providing a standard of comparison (Cronin  1999:  24),  Wendt  argues  that  the  ‘self  organizing  structure’  is  like  a  body  (of  knowledge, presumably) and that “having a body means you are different than  someone  else’s  body,  but  that  does  not  mean  that  his  body  constitutes  yours  in  any  interesting  way” (Wendt  1999:  225).
This defense  is weak not only because  its appeal  relies on the  metaphor of a human  ‘body’  as  a self-organizing biological  organism, which  cannot  be  applied  to the  state,  as Wendt himself recognizes.
Substantiating  it would  require  discussing what constitutes  a states’  self-consciousness,  how  it  is  organized  and  why  society -  which  always  slips  in  when  Wendt talks about the state as having a consciousness -  develops a (collective) mind-set  isolated from others/the world.
Thus,  despite  all  the  claims  to  the  contrary,  in  Wendt’s  picture  ‘the  essential  state’  appears  like  a  stable  and  isolated  something.144  Instead  of  providing  a  theoretical  narrative with a novel ontology and a corresponding conception of (security)  interest,  in  the  end  Wendt’s  discussion  of the  state  as a  ‘person’  only  serves to justify defining the  ‘national  interest’  with  reference to familiar basic  needs:  survival,  autonomy, economic  well-being,  and  self-esteem  (in that order).
With  the  possible  exception  of the  last one,  there  is  no  sign  that  these  interests  are  generated  by  identity  or  ideas  or  in  any  way  143  Wendt (2006) recognised this as being the central problem of his theory and  is working on a  new one that focuses on consciousness through Quantum theory.
144  His  insistence that his theory  is  not concerned with  “state  identity  formation”  (Wendt  1999:  11)  nor  with  offering  a  “theory  of the  state”  (Wendt  2006:  208)  looks  odd  alongside  an  entire  chapter  on  the  state,  including  an  extensive  conceptualisation  of state  identities  (Ch.
This  reading  of  borders  is  captured  in  Wendt’s  notion  of  ‘fuzzy’  boundaries  and  most  explicitly  in  Adler’s  notion  of  ‘cognitive  regions’,  which  is  echoed  in  the  view  of  “communities  developing]  around  networks,  interactions,  and  face-to-face  encounters  that  are  not  dependent  on  inhabiting  the  same  geographic  space”  (Adler  and  Barnett  1998:  33;  Adler  1997;  also  Cronin  1999).
Adler  and  Barnett  assert  that  “domestic  characteristics  and  practices”  must  be  “consistent with the community” (36), yet at the same time they shy away from adopting  a  thorough  transnational  perspective  by  focusing  on  ‘pluralistic  security  communities’  where  states  maintain  their  ‘sovereignty’  (Adler  and  Barnett  1998:  5).
Hence,  for  both  Campbell  and  Zehfuss  the  state  is  not  a  unitary/stable  entity  whose Selfhood is defined in isolation from the world, but something that exists only by  constantly  (re)instating  ‘its’  borders,  always  “in  the  process  of  becoming”  through  practices  of representation  of Otherness  and  the  construction  of boundaries  (Campbell  1998:  12).145  Wendt’s response to this critique that IR scholars only need to know which  understanding  ‘wins’  the  domestic  debate  is  unsatisfactory,  not  the  least  because  it  blocks out the role of transnational  links in bringing this  ‘victory’  about.146  The dynamic perspective brings the temporal dimension into the moderate constructivist  narrative.
In  the  constructivist  narrative  the  content  of  this  belief  depends  on  the  ‘stage’  the  relationship  ‘mature’  security  community  and  Cronin’s  collective  security  systems  all  have  in  common  that  its  members come to believe that the other will not attack them at any time and, hence, have  ‘Kantian  culture’,  Adler/Barnett’s   is   in.
Yet  the  notion  that  shared  knowledge  plays  a  key  role  in  managing  the  temporal  situatedness  of the  state  already  reads  more  into  the  constructivist  narrative  than  most  authors  care  to  do.
More  precisely,  preoccupied  with  how  norms  are  ‘internalized’  through  processes  of  interaction,  the  moderate  constructivist  narrative  does  not  sufficiently  engage  the  role  of the  past or  specify  why  and  how  norms  matter  for the  future.
This  weakness  is  meta-theoretical  and  rooted  in  how  moderate  constructivists  approach  the  task  of  ‘showing  a  way  beyond’  realism:  Because the causal  narrative in which the concept is integrated focuses  147 For an attempt of a more substantial treatment of ‘communities of practice’, see Adler (2005).
interrogated  three  research  programmes  -   realism,   Conclusion This  chapter  institutionalism,  constructivism -  by tracing their causal narratives to their respective hard core, that is, to  an  ontology  of the  state  and  its  ‘security  interest’  deducted  from  an  account  of  the  human  condition,  understood  as  a  reading  of the  spatio-temporal  situatedness  of  ‘the  state’.
The  main  purpose  was  to  carve  out  the  main  elements  of  the  three  causal  narratives  and  trace their weakness  in  explaining the  ‘novel  fact’  of German-American  security  cooperation,  hoping  to  find  some  analytical  openings  which  can  be  carried  forward for the task of creative theorizing.
The  discussion  showed  that  from  a  deep  theory  perspective  only  realism  presents  an  original  research  programme  and,  as  such,  an  original  causal  narrative  of  interstate  security  cooperation.
Its  definition  of  the  national  security  interest  as  a  desire  for  survival (or self-preservation) understood as maintaining territorial  integrity is anchored  in  a  (Hobbesian)  account  of the  human  condition  of states  as  autonomous  individuals  distrusting  each  other  because  they  read  an  uncertain  future  through  a  certain  past,  namely  a  past  of  conflict/violence.
They  do  not  offer  an  alternative  conception  of  the  state  and  its  national  security  interest  and,  consequently,  lack  a  substantial  argument  for  what  is  means  for  states  to  have  such  interests in common (or not).
That said, for the purpose of creative theorizing the analysis encourages taking seriously  the three basic elements characterising these three causal narratives:  uncertainty as a key  feature of the human condition (realism), institutions as a modifying structure which can  alter the  ‘informational  environment’  (institutionalism), and  Self-Other interdependence  as  an  integrative  force  leading  to  the  spatial  extension  of  ‘the  state’.
91  CHAPTER FOUR: RETHINKING THE HUMAN CONDITION  Sum m ary  international   security  cooperation,   realism,   image,  which  was  modified  yet  not   The  previous  chapter  unravelled  three  IR  research  programmes  offering  a  causal  narrative  on  institutionalism,  and  constructivism to reveal their logical  weaknesses  in  explaining dynamics as  in  the  case  at  hand  and  search  for  conceptual  openings.
In  an  attempt  to  build  a  ‘better’  -   more  suitable  -   deep  theory,  this  chapter  leaves the plane of IR to provide the  philosophical  ground  from  which the  state  and  its  motive  for  investing  in  international  security  institutions  can  be  rethought  (in  subsequent chapters).
Its objective is to offer a reading of the human condition different  from  the  Hobbesian  one  and  to  thereby  arrive  at  a  new  ontology  of the  state  and  its  security interest, i.e.
an understanding of what it means to be secure.
The  chapter  suggests  that  shifting  attention  to  the  Selfs  attempt of coming to  terms  with  anxiety  requires  understanding  how the  Self seeks orientation through meaningful knowledge of itself and  ‘the world’.
Two  strategies  for  gaining  such  ‘ontological  security’  are  discussed,  namely  mathematical  measuring  and  routine  practices  (Giddens),  both  of which  are  criticized  by  drawing  on  Heidegger’s  notion  of  Verfallen  for  failing  to  provide  the  Self with  ‘authenticity’.
This  dilemma  -   gaining  ontological  security  at  the  cost  of authenticity  -   is  termed  the  ‘anxiety  dilemma’.
Given the ambiguity of the term  and the apparent failure of moderate  constructivists to build a new theory on  it, as discussed  in the previous chapter, this step  requires  some  adjustment.
In  other words,  while  ‘identity’  has  been  overused  analytically  in  IR,  it  cannot  be  ignored  that  scholars  have  provided  convincing  accounts  of  how  concerns  about  ‘identity’  affect  foreign  and  security  policy.149  Indeed,  as  Hans  Joas  (2000:  15If) points out, ever since ‘identity’ was introduced as a sociological concept in  the early 20th century the view has prevailed that it is  good to have an  ‘identity’.
It follows the  logic,  noted  in  chapter one,  that to  define a  states’  security  interest  and,  hence, to know what the state seeks protection from (the existential threat) requires  an  understanding  of what  it  means  for the  state  to  be  (to  exist).
Reading the Human Condition with Heidegger151 Largely  ignored  by  IR  scholars,152  Heidegger  can  be  considered  one  of  the  most  influential philosophers of the 20th century.153 His standing as a thinker and relevance for  the purpose at hand  stems primarily from  his attempt of devising an ontology of ‘being’  in  his  1927  magnum  opus Sein  und Zeit (‘Being and  Time’).154  In this work,  Heidegger  explored  the  basic  ontological  question  “what  we  actually  mean  with  the  expression  ‘being’”  ‘existential  phenomenology’.
(Heidegger  1953:  1 1)  and  developed  what   is  known  as   151 Again,  I am neither trying to turn Heidegger into an IR theorist nor to reconstruct his argument  in  detail  (an  impossible  task  anyhow).
This  lack  of  interest  in  Heidegger among IR scholars stems likely from a combined dislike of his biography (a supporter  of National Socialism in the  1930s), of what he said (not much about international politics) and of  the  way  he  wrote (complex arguments  expressed  in  often  opaque  language),  which  has  left him  rarely  engaged  in  fields  outside  philosophy (see  also  Elden  2004).
94  Importantly, such  ‘knowledge’  gained through experience  is not knowledge in the sense  of accumulated  information  but  as  having  generated  structures  of meaning which  lend  significance to the world (meaning understood as Bedeutung).
In  short,  phenomenology  involves  the  study  of  how  ‘things’,  including  Selfhood,  obtain  meaning  through  experience.156  Convinced that one cannot devise an abstract theory of consciousness, as Husserl tried to  do,  Heidegger’s  existential  phenomenology  puts  forward  a  method  for  ‘fundamental  ontology’  allowing  for  an  “examination  into  what  life  might  reveal  itself  to  be”  (Odysseos  2002:  381).157  It  is  important  not  to  confuse  this  ‘existentialist’  perspective  with  a  commitment to  ‘essentialism’  in  the  sense  of locating the  intrinsic  substance  of  something  (in  this  case  the  Self).
In  Heidegger’s  view,  the  meaning  of being  can  only  be  grasped  through  an  account  of  our  specific  understanding  of  being,  which  requires  grasping our experience of and with  ‘the world’  and the meaning structure this gives rise  to (Frede 2006; also Odysseos 2007:  3Iff).
While  Heidegger did  not  present  (did  not  aim  at  presenting)  a  theory  of the  Self  ‘as  such’,  his  analysis  of  “existential  understanding”  (Heidegger  1953:  12)  certainly  makes  him  a  foundational  figure  interpretative  approach  similar  to  Weber’s  notion  of  Verstehen and further developed by Hans-Georg Gadamer (2004  [1975]; Hoy  1993).
the  continuation  of  the   in  hermeneutics,  an   Being-in-the-Worldas  ‘Unfolding* Heidegger develops his  understanding of being or,  in his terminology, Dasein'59  as one  of ‘being-in-the-world’.
Time  and  space  are  the  two  dimensions in and through which the Self develops its ‘worldliness’.
As  Peter  Sloterdijk  points  out,  Sein  und  Zeit  “contains  the  seed  of  a  revolutionary  treatise  on  being  and  space”  (Sloterdijk  1998:  336,  my  translation)  and  Jeff Malpas  even  suggests  that  Heidegger’s  overall  work  provides  “perhaps  the  most  important  and  sustained  inquiry  into  place  found  in  the  history  of  Western  thought”  (Malpas 2006: 3; also Elden, 2001).
In  conceptualizing this  ‘situatedness’  of the  Self,  contained  in  the  term Da-Sein which  literally means ‘being-there’, Heidegger rejects the Cartesian notion  of geometric space, a res extensa that can be measured objectively (see also below).
As  he  puts   it,  “das  Dasein   fulfilment  arrived  at   through   internal   reflection  but  occurs   Heidegger  is  clear  that  ‘unfolding’  is  not  reducible  to  a  mental  process.
It  is  not  mere  spiritual  through  involvement/engagement and,  thus,  activity (or practice, to use the term  popular among  pragmatists).
98  mutual constitution with the Self, the process of disclosing is not simply about gathering  information  from  a  pre-existing world  located  outside the  Self.
Unfolding encompasses  all  kinds  of  seeing  ‘the  world’,  including  forgetting  (Heidegger  1953:  62)  and  is  a  creative process.
100  influences  behaviour requires exploring how the Self reacts to (deals with) anxiety, how  it structures its sense of being-in-the-world.
As  the  following  discussion  shows,  there  is  ample  evidence  that  the  Self  does  not  embrace  anxiety  but  seeks  ways  to  tame  the  same  by  reducing  or  ‘controlling’  contingency.
To use the terminology offered  by Anthony  Giddens,  the  question  then  becomes  what  “anxiety  controlling  mechanisms”  are  employed  by  the  unfolding  Self to  obtain  this  sense  of stability,  or what  Giddens  calls  ‘ontological  security’  (Giddens  1984:  50;  also  Giddens  1991).
The  below  discussion  reviews two prominent strategies of how humans attempt to  ‘tame’  anxiety and  create a  sense  of continuity -  through  mathematical  symbols and  routine  practices -  and  draws  on Heidegger to suggest that these  ‘mechanisms’ fall short because they do not allow for  authentic being.
The unity of Ulysses’  adventures remains external to the  individual,  it is  a  sequence  of events  in  places  dominated  by  local  gods  in  which  “the  inner  form  of  organizing  individuality,  time,  remains  weak”  (Horkheimer  and  Adorno  1988:  55).
the  condition   the  fundamental  paradox  characterizing   The Anxiety Paradox This  account  reveals  the  ‘enlightened’  individual,  which  I  call  the  ‘anxiety-paradox’:  awareness  of its  ability  to  organize  the  temporal  world  is  accompanied  by  reluctance  of  fully  accepting  the  consequences  and  an  attempt  to  re-introduce  an  eternal  perspective.
Tellingly,  Henri  Bergson,  whose  work  on  the temporal  constitution  of the  evolutionary  Self has recently been  reclaimed as an avantgarde of postmodern thinking,  notes  at  one  point  that  the  “natural  inclination”  of the  mind  is  to  proceed  “by  solid  perceptions...and  stable  conceptions”  (cited  in  Grosz  2005:  135).
Modern Answers: Numbers and Routines There  are  two  strategies  of  mastering  time  and  space  dominating  modem  societies,  namely  mathematical  measures  (scientific  time/space)  and  routine  practices.
Mathematical  measurement  allows  humans  to  increasingly  live  “within  a  world  of symbols  of their  own  making”  (Elias,  1992:  42).
Hence, along Kantian lines this ‘Cartesian’  approach assumes  that the  scientific conception  of time and  space  is universally accessible through  reason  (Elias  1992:  123).
Designed  and  supported  with  can  be  neatly  mechanical/computerized  measures,  time  becomes  cognitively  controllable  and  universally accessible through mathematical logic, manifest in the Western calendar, the  24-hour  clock,  and  ‘timetables’  which  map  out past  and  future  and  allow  synchronised  planning.168  Time  if  part  of  the  eternal  order  ‘running’  (flowing/passing)  external  to  human  thought.
Once  the  medieval  image  of a  flat  earth  sandwiched  between  heaven  and  hell  was  discredited,  science  became  the  new  authority  for  ‘accurately  representing’  or  mapping  space,  carefully  recording  of  ‘the  world’,  including  the  existence  of  states.
As  John  Agnew  points  out,  mathematical  measures  enhance  the  sense  that  modem  mapping  is  devoid  of bias  and  convince  the  reader  of “a  fairly  close  approximation  between  the  maps  and  what  [lies]  ‘out  there’  in  the  world  beyond  immediate  experience”.
The  second  anxiety  controlling  mechanisms  are  eveiyday  practices,  or  routines,  which  may be seen as complementary to scientific measures or as reducing contingency in their  own  right.
Routines  play  a  central  role  in  Giddens’  structuration  theory,  a  popular  reference  for  moderate  constructivists,  some  of whom  have  recently  also  emphasized  their  function  of  providing  ontological  security  to  states  (Giddens  1984,  1991).169  Echoing  the  human  condition  as  marked  by  awareness  of  being  positioned  in  ‘irreversible  time’  (Giddens  1984:  35),  a  term  taken  from  Bergson,  Giddens  draws  on  Heidegger to argue that the  Self seeks  ‘anxiety controlling mechanisms’.
He argues that  the  Self attempts to establish  a sense of temporal continuity through everyday practices,  or routines which, for Giddens are carried over from the past and established  in a social  setting.170 Yet contingency is reduced not simply because practices are being shared but  by  because  it  being  a  routine,  that  is,  by  carrying  a  familiarity  that  comes  from  being  ‘established’  in  the  past and  carried  over through  formal  or  informal  institutional  rules.
The  appeal  of routine  practices  is  thus  that they  hold  the  promise to  exist  indefinitely.
Mathematical  measures  and  routine  practices  seem  well  suited  to  control  anxiety  by  providing  individuals  with  a  structural  promise  for  continuity.
For an  adaptations of his notion of ontological security sustained through  routine  practice to IR, see Huysmans (1998a); Mitzen (2006).
According to  Bergson the  individual’s thinking  in  time primarily occurs not on a cognitive but on an emotional level, and its  ‘inner time’  is  grounded  in  the  “quality”  of  lived  experience,  in  the  “intensity”  of  the  sensations  triggered  internally  in  response  to  ‘external’  events  (Guerlac,  2006:  6 If).
Anderson (2006) and Tilly (1994) who describe the evolution of temporal orders as a function of  modernisation  and  focus  on  how  the  desire  for  continuity/simultaneity  in  modem  societies  is  exploited  by,  that  is,  how  the  anxiety  controlling  mechanisms  are  controlled  by,  some  larger  structural  force, such as capitalism.
107  The Anxiety Dilemma:  Verfallen and Authenticity Much  of  the  critique  directed  against  scientific  time  can  be  extended  to  everyday  practices through  Heidegger’s  discussion  of the  phenomenon  of Verfallen.
‘Curiosity’  makes  the  Self  eager  to  disclose  ever  more  of the  world,  which  is  made  accessible  through  ‘idle  talk’  and  ‘ambiguity’  enabling  loose  communication  (Ibid.,  167-175).
Everyday  practices  are  momentarily  acts  which  make  the  presence  stand  out  more  sharply  and  which  allow  temporal  orientation without paying attention to past and future.
Even when routines are  linked to  a  ‘tradition’  and  seen  as an extension of ‘quality’  experiences passed  on through formal  or  informal  rules,  by  themselves  routines  do  not  provide  a  source  for  meaningful  orientation.
The Anxiety Dilemma While these critiques of scientific time and the everyday echo the Zeitgeist of the  1920s  lamenting  a  dehumanization  of the  individual  in  the  industrial  age,  from  an  analytical  perspective  the  temptation  of getting  lost  in  these  ‘calming’  temporal  orders  turns  the  175  Similarly,  Elias  notes  the  calming effect  of organizing temporal  space  in  universal  terms  as  “people’s  attempts  to  run  away  from  themselves”  (Elias  1992:  84).
Note  that  Vefallen  differs  from Marx’  notion of ‘alienation’  in  important ways:  For Marxists,  alienation  is  seen as  a result  of economic structures built on  capitalist logic (and,  in the  Gramscian  variant,  with  ideology on  top) controlled by the state and, thus, expression of a power structure which, if recognized by the  oppressed,  could be overcome.
By contrast,  for Heidegger  Verfallen  is a process not imposed by  some  political-economic  superstructure  but  something  chosen  by  the  individual,  an  inevitable  consequence  of the  human  condition  in  search  for  ontological  security.
Although  by  speaking  about temptations Heidegger opens up to the possibility to resist, this is more an internal struggle  not  one  against  an  external  structure  such  as  the  state.
109  anxiety  paradox  into  a dilemma:  scientific  time  and  everyday  routines  may  function  as  anxiety  controlling  mechanisms,  but  they  prevent  the  Self  from  becoming  authentic.
They  provide  ontological  security  by  embedding  the  Self  into  structures  promising  ‘continuity’  and ‘simultaneity’  at the cost of authenticity, more precisely by reducing the  possibility of having an  authentic experience (what Bergson called the  ‘fundamental’  or  ‘passionate’  Self).
Rethinking Authenticity The  way  out  of  the  anxiety  dilemma  offered  here  is,  first,  to  suggest  that  humans  develop  a  desire  for  ‘authenticity’  to  control  (perhaps  even  take  away)  anxiety  and,  second, to rethink how a state of authentic being is obtained.
Including  a  desire  for  authenticity  in  the  causal  narrative  is  only  the  first  step.
In particular the latter two points inform  Charles Guignon’s suggestion that  “Authenticity  is  characterised  by  a  distinctive  temporal  structure  (...)  an  authentic  life  is  lived  as  a  unified  flow  characterized  by  cumulativeness  and  direction.
It  involves taking over the  possibilities  made accessible  by  the  past and  acting  in  the  present to accomplish  something for the future.
The  chapter  concluded  with  arguing  that  the  attempt  to  control  anxiety  is  expressed in a desire for ‘authentic becoming’.
Using the opening of statehood resting  on  a  ‘binding  idea’,  the  below  discussion  develops  a  reading  of the  state  as  a  national  biography  defined  as  a  coherent  life  story  through  which  societies  gain  orientation  in  ‘the  world’  by  inscribing  space  and  time  with  meaning.
Against  this  backdrop,  the  national  security  interest can  be  understood  as generating and  safeguarding an  authentic  national  biography.
In  light  of the  discussion  in  the  previous  chapter,  this  demand  can  be  understood  as  ‘controlling  anxiety’  by generating a stable sense o f ‘authentic becoming’.
The former assumes the existence of a certain  group or community with  or  without  a direct  link  to  a  state  understood  as  a territorially  exclusive  entity,  if anything  considered  more  basic  and  preceding,  indeed,  claiming  ‘their  own’  state  (nation  ->  state).
115  The  perspective  taken  in  this  chapter  is  of  the  constructivist  kind,  emphasizing  nationalism  as  a phenomenon  created,  substantiated  and  sustained  by  political  practice.
At  least  since  Robert Jervis’  (1976)  work  on  the  effect  of  belief systems  on  foreign  policy  making,  scholars  have  shown  that  ideas  introduce  a  183 The concept is also mentioned in passing by Steele (2005).
186 As  noted  in the  last  chapter,  even constructivists such  as  Wendt who strongly  emphasize the  “constitutive effect” of ideas on the self-conception of states don’t see them working ‘all the way  down’  (Wendt  1999:  Ch.
Systematic  attempts  such  as  by  Judith  Goldstein  and  Robert  Keohane (1993)  fail  to  anchor the  notion that  ideas  help to  order the  world by  providing “road  maps”  or  “focal  points”  in  a  deep  theory  of international  politics  and  end  up  treating  them  as  ‘intervening variables’.
For  instance,  while  it  could  be  argued  that  the  ‘objective’/ ‘existential’  distinction  is  analytically  useful  to  explain  how  the  ‘same’  event  is  experienced  differently  by  different  individuals,  this  actually  does  not  require  the  notion  of  an  ‘objective’  world.
In  other  words,  it  is  to  take  serious  the  political  implications  of  what  Gaston  Bachelard  has  called  ‘topophilia’, or love of place, as an anxiety controlling mechanism.
Norms  are  seen  as  necessary   The  emphasis on  norms is heavily influenced  by social  contract thinking and the related  advocacy  of  specific  but  potentially  universally  valid  rules  of  behaviour  to  organize  social  through  understandings of what  is the  ‘right’  thing to do,  such  as  stopping at red  lights,  guiding  the  S elfs  activities  along  a  ‘logic  of appropriateness’.
This  is  done  by values.197  As  Kratochwil  (1989:  64)  notes,  values  are  more  general  than  norms,  or  rules,  and  inform  attitudes  and  generate emotional attachment.
As  such,  values  rank  the  importance  or  quality of something,  including a norm, and are attributed to things which satisfy desires  and  create  a  ‘good’  feeling,  stirring  emotions.
Yet while one can imagine an abundance of possible norms, or  rules,  tied  to  and  varying  with  specific  contexts,  values  go  deeper  and  are  about  evaluating  which  norms  serve  as  the  Selfs  primary  orientation  devices  and  create  the  ‘good’  feeling.
For  Heidegger a  meaningful  space  is  one  in  which  ‘things  have their place’  and  where  distance  to  the  Self is  not  measured  in  physical  proximity  but  according  to  the  value  attributed  to  things  (wertbehaftet)  (Heidegger,  1953:  63,  66,  102f.).
Horizons: Delineating the Possible The third feature engages the understanding that spatial orientation requires some sort of  boundary,  or  border  (Simmel  1922:  465f).
The  general  observation  made  by  Harold  and  Margaret  Sprout  that  the  ‘environmental’  terminology  used  by  scholars of international  politics  is vague still  holds true (Sprout and  Sprout  1965:  5ff).
124  thereby  often  loosing  sight  of the  state  altogether.201  That  said,  there  are  three  areas  where  scholars  of international  politics  have  devised  perspectives  which  provide useful  entry points for conceptualising the state as an  experienced  space,  namely those dealing  with phenomena or ‘empire’,  ‘milieu’  and ‘regionalism’.
That said, the conceptualisation  of  ‘empire’  is  much  debated  and  preoccupied  with  the  nature  of  control  outside  the  ‘core’  state  rather  than  the  ontological  configuration  of  the  same.
While  Gramscian  and  Foucauldian  frameworks  offer  new  ways of ‘tracing’  empire, the  spatial  configuration  of empire, more precisely the spatial situatedness  of  states  within  it  is  overshadowed  by  questions  of  (how  to  measure) power.
reach/presence,  control  of   international  markets,  and   the   202  Political  geographers  in  Britain  and  Germany  in  the  late  19th  century  spoke  to  the  imperial  ambitions  of  their  governments  and  developed  concepts  used  for  mapping  spatial  spheres  of  influence  and  areas  of  strategic  (‘vital’)  importance.
In  Germany,  Friedrich  Ratzel  developed  conceptual  ideas  for the  study  of  the  state  as  a  spatial  phenomenon  influenced  by  social  Darwinism  and  suggested  to  conceive  of the  state  as  a  living organism  and  identified  ‘space’  and  ‘position’  as  “the  two  principle  determinants  of  the  fortunes  of  states”  (Parker  1995:  170).
This  was  married  to  notion  of Lebensraum,  or  living  space,  the  ‘adequate  acquisition’  of which  was,  according  to  Ratzel,  of  fundamental  importance  to  provide  society  with  the  exploring   the   space,   in  particular,   ‘globalisation’  of   201  Studies  the  ‘deterritorialisation’  of  political  space  through  (mainly  economic)  structures  or  networks  emerging  above  and  beyond  ‘states’  without  rethinking  the  spatial  configuration  of  ‘states’  themselves  (Ferguson  and  Jones,  2002).
202  Muenkler (2007);  Katzenstein  (2005);  Forum  on  ‘The  ‘New’  American  Empire’  in  Security  Dialogue 35(2): 227-61.  emphasize   125  resources necessary to develop  its  potential  (O Tuathail,  1998:  4,  20f).
Said  differently,  shaping the  ‘milieu’  is  about  influencing the  development of a  space  beyond  its  Westphalian  borders,  a  space  which  ‘the  state’  neither  owns  nor  controls but whose constellation  it nevertheless considers of vital  importance for its well  being.205  Although none of these authors are concerned with rethinking the ontology of the state -   indeed  they do not question  its  composition  as  a territorial  unit -  their attempt to think  about a symbiotic relationship with the environment goes some way towards the  idea of  an  ‘experienced space’.
For  instance,  Barry  Buzan  and  Ole  Waever’s  ‘Regional  Security Complexes’  are  objectively identifiable  ‘subsystems’  in  a  neorealist  world  of  anarchy,  rooted  territoriality  and  defined  by  (perceived)  security  interdependence  amongst  its  entities  (states)  (Buzan  and  Waever  2003:  11,  41-49,  80-  87).
As Buzan and Waever note, this framework does not deal  with the political  practice  of “labelling regions”, that is,  how regional  spaces  are constructed  from the  perspective  of ‘the  state’  and  the meaning given to them,  let alone  how the  state  sees  itself situated  within a ‘region’  (Buzan and Waever 2003: 48).207  in   More  fruitful  for  the  present  purpose  is  David  Lake  and  Patrick  Morgan’s  (1997)  conception  of regions,  which  picks up  Andrew Hurrell’s  point that notions  of ‘regional  awareness’,  ‘regional  identity’  and  ‘regional consciousness’  are central to the analysis of  regionalism.
In  the  same  vein,  and  with  a  focus  on  the  security  realm,  Emanuel  Adler  suggests  that  understanding  of how  people  create  security  requires  examining the  link  between  their  images  of  reality  and  “the  places  and  regions  that  people  feel  comfortable  calling  ‘home’” (Adler  1997a:  249).
This  is  not  merely  because the  empirical  puzzle deals with  institutions addressing  ‘European  security’  but,  in confirmation of Hurrell’s (1995:  45) claim that the study of European  integration  has  done most to advance the theoretical analysis of ‘regionalism’, because the phenomenon  of  ‘Europeanisation’  comes  closest  to  capturing  the  image  of a  state  unfolding  in  an  experienced  space.
Attempts  to  come  to  terms with  Ruggie’s  (1993:  140)  assessment that the  spatial  complexes  associated  with  the  EU  “may  constitute  nothing  less  than  the  emergence  of  the  truly  postmodern  international political form” provide fertile ground for rethinking ‘the state’  in space.
That  said,  the  ‘Europeanisation’  perspective  has  one  weakness which  it  shares  with  the  moderate  constructivist  narrative  discussed  earlier:  by  implying  a  progressive  development,  the  Westphalian  state  remains  the  starting  point  and  the  ‘European’  dimension is conceived of as something new, a recent phenomenon which is product of a  socialisation  process  through  participation  in  European  integration.
This reservoir is accessed through memory  or,  more  precisely,  by  “memory  space”  (Assmann,  1999).
Indeed one might even say the memoiy space  is the past the Self lives in.213 The significance of memories for the national biography is  that  they  are  rooted  in  and  thereby  give  access  to  experience  (Koselleck,  1985).
Unfolding  through  a  memory  space  requires  a  reflective  Self  as  the  process  of  remembering involves an  evaluation -  learning and  interpretation -  of experience.
Irwin-Zarecka  (1994)  speaks  of  a  “household”  or  “infrastructure”  of memory,  where  memory is ‘held alive’ through various media and practices.
Those memories which appear like replica of the past do  so because they are translated  into and made accessible through language, whereas those experiences which cannot be  articulated  remain  ‘personal’.
Memory  spaces  cannot  sufficiently  center the  Self, that  is,  control  its  anxiety  and  satisfy  the  desire  for  stability/continuity,  for  two  reasons:  first,  as  noted  above,  significant  experiences  will  always  remain  a  source  of ambiguity,  and  the  lessons  ‘learned’  from  them  are  never  definite.
Even  if the theoretical  narrative developed here does not adopt Heidegger’s point that only  in  facing  ones  own  death  the  ‘moment  of  vision’  emerges  in  which  grasping  authentic  being  is  possible,  it  does  adopt  the  view  that  the  ability  to  delineate  a  distinctive  meaningful  future,  which  one  is  able  to  ‘claim’  and  move  towards,  is  necessary  for  authentic becoming.
In  a  way,  utopias  or  visions  of  the  ‘good’  order  projected  into  the  future  provide  the  complementary anxiety  controlling  mechanism  to  the  memory  space  created  by  significant  experiences.
By delineating  this  place to  be,  utopias provide the  direction  for unfolding  and,  as  such,  are  confirmed  through  practices.
Realism  emerged  as  a  normative-analytical  corrective  intended  to  warn  policymakers  ‘blinded’  by  the  wrong  ideas  of how  the  world  works,  and  so  giving  analytical  importance  to  utopias  other  than  those  advocated  by  realist  worst-case  scenarios  was  discouraged.221  Although  scholars  have  rehabilitated  ideas  and  acknowledge  that  they  may  serve  as  “road  maps”  and  “focal  points”  defining  “the  universe  of  possibilities”  in  the  future  (Goldstein  and  Keohane  1993:  8),  with  Wendt  at  one  point  suggesting  that  state  219  I  am  using  ’visions’  when  referring  to  ideas  of  order  projected  into  the  future  because  ‘utopias’  and ‘ideologies’ are too laden with meaning in the general understanding.
Karl Mannheim describes utopias as “methods of  thought by means of which we  arrive at  our most crucial  decisions,  and through which  we  seek  to  diagnose  and  guide  our  political  and  social  destiny”  (Mannheim  1936:  If)  and Tower Sargent claims that “utopian thinking it essential for our social, political, and  psychological  health”,  quoting  Oscar  Wilde  saying that  “a  map  of the  world  that  does  not include utopia is not worth even glancing at” (Tower Sargent 2005: 4).
At  the  same  time,  visions  of  the  future  may  also  encompass  a  dystopia,  that  is,  they  may  include  pictures  not  only  of  ‘better  worlds’  (characterized  by  the  good/desirable  order)  but  also  of undesirable  ones  (characterized  by  the  bad/undesirable  order).
One prominent example is Karl  Mannheim’s work.
They are ‘wish-images’  giving rise to  practice  challenging  and  breaking  with  “the  order  of  things  prevailing  at  the  time”,  which  makes  them  revolutionary  in  character  and  different  from  ‘ideologies’  which  Mannheim  sees  as  more  conservative.223  Yet  while  Mannheim  gives  a  negative  connotation  to  both,  he  tries  to  reconcile  the  tension  in  Marx’  by  mentioning  forward-  looking  ideas  that  are  ‘appropriate’  in  the  sense  that they  neither  ignore  nor  challenge  the existing order but remain “’organically’  and harmoniously integrated  into the world­ view  characteristic  of  the  period”  (Ibid,  193).
223  „Not  until  certain  social  groups  embodied these  wish-images  into  their  actual  conduct,  and  tried to realize them, did these ideologies become utopian" (Mannheim,  1936:  193)  139  “the  truest  visions  of  religions  are  illusions,  which  may  be  partly  realized  by  being  resolutely  believed”  (in  Carr,  2001  [1946]:  85).
Carr’s critique of  ‘idealism’  thus  is  compromised  by  recognizing that  ‘pure  realism’  can  offer  nothing  in  satisfying human aspirations; once a utopia is demolished, he concedes, “we still need to  build  a new  utopia (...) The  human will  continue to  seek  an  escape...in  the vision  of an  international  order”  (Carr  2001  (1946):  87).
Even  realist  scholars  accept  the  human  need  for  utopias  as  an  anxiety  controlling  mechanism,  indeed  by  producing their worst-case  scenarios they  are  in  the  business  of  producing  their  own.
As  noted  earlier,  for  it to  work  as  a meaningful  reference,  a vision  must be  considered  possible  and  must have  a  reference somewhere, which  means that place  in the future cannot be radically  ‘new’.226  In other words, the purpose of utopias is not to confirm the contingency of the future but  224  For  a  recent  argument  along  similar  lines,  see  Lawson  (2008).
Pursuing  a  meaningful  vision  through  the  memory  space  connects  past  and  future  to  a  coherent  narrative  and  controls  anxiety.
It  is,  rather,  an  existential  of  being  which  requires  not  administrative  but  creative  capacity,  that  is,  agency.
Agency  here  appears  similar  to  what  Emirbayer  and  Mische  (1998:  970)  have  described  as  a  temporally embedded  process where decisions are  informed (1)  by the  past,  stimulating  an element of iteration based on past patterns of thought and action (here:  ‘learning’), (2)  by  the  future,  stimulating  an  element  of projection  based  on  the  capacity  to  imagine  alternative  possibilities,  and  (3)  by  the  present,  stimulating  an  element  of  practical  evaluation.
It  was  argued  that  the  state,  maintained  by  a  community  sharing  a  sense  of  ‘Self,  controls  anxiety  and  stabilizes  its  being-in-the-world  world  through a coherent narrative where meaning is inscribed in an experienced space ordered  and bound by value horizons and projected into an envisioned space.
Second,  the  chapter argues that friendship  has  been  underconceptualized  in  IR  and  that  existing  accounts  focusing  on  ‘group  membership’  are  unsuitable  for  accommodating  desires  of  authenticity.
Finally,  discussing the empowerment effect  of friendship through investment in a shared project, the chapter concludes with arguing  that international institutions serve as platforms through which this project is negotiated.
This task is pursued  in this  chapter  by  (a)  picking  up  Taylor’s  (1994)  suggestion  that  an  authentic  narrative  is  created  not through  a  monologue but through dialogue with  a significant Other and  (b)  combine this with Robert Dostal’s point that the weakness of Heidegger’s conception of  authentic  solicitude  becomes  apparent  when  compared  with  Aristotle’s  discussion  of  friendship  as  a  fulfilling  relationship.233  It  thus  follows  the  line  of  reasoning  that  “cooperation  is  ultimately based  on  understandings actors  develop about themselves,  in  particular,  recognition  of the  importance  of relationships  to  fulfilment  of their  deepest  needs”  (Lebow  2003:  311).
Trust and openness is seen as both engaging  232  Indeed,  on the  basis  of a review of all  of Heidegger’s  publications (available by the time he  wrote  his  article)  Dostal  concludes that  in  Heidegger’s  philosophy there  is  “no  development  of  the understanding o f ‘Being-with’ (Mitsein)” (Dostal  1992: 408).
147  irn  intimate  self-disclosure  and  keeping  confidential  information,  while  honesty  and  loyalty  is  linked  to  authenticity  and  genuine  commitments  (Fehr  1996:  3-16).
Through  this  exclusivity,  friends  are  seen  as  reinforcing  and  moulding  each  other’s  sense  of  Self by  creating  moral  certainty  and  social  capital  for pursuing common  projects,  capable of both  carrying and  transforming  order through a space marked by intimacy and reciprocal assistance.234  These  insights,  which  appear  in  writings  on  friendship  all  the  way  back  to  Aristotle,  have  not  been  picked  up  by  scholars  of  international  politics.
And  Wendt,  who  notably  suggests  that  IR  needs  a  theory  of friendship,  does  not  go  beyond  portraying  it  as  a  ‘Kantian  culture’  where  relations  are  characterized  by  non­ violence and mutual aid,  mainly differing from alliances by being expected “to continue  indefinitely”,  which  does  not  much  more  than  echoing  Adler’s  reformulation  of  Deutsch’s  security  community  (Wendt  1999:  298fi).
235  For  a  discourse  analysis  tracing  the  meaning  ‘friendship’  or  ‘amity’  has  taken  on  in  international politics, who uses it, why, and to what effect, see Roshchin (2006).
While  there  is  consensus  among  constructivists  that  stabilization  of the  Self occurs  through  ordering  practices  is  considerable  disagreement (if not confusion) when  it comes to  specify the  ‘nature’  of the  Self-Other  relationship, that is,  when  it comes to the question  how to conceptualize  ‘Otherness’.238  As noted earlier, diverse and potentially contradictory readings are rooted in the fact that  the very notion  o f ‘identity’  contains an  insolvable tension between meaning ‘similarity’  (relationality) and  ‘distinctiveness’ (individuality) between which all kinds of Self-Other  conceptualizations can flourish.239 Broadly speaking, two approaches can be identified in  the IR literature, those emphasizing the Other as the  ‘enemy’  and those emphasizing the  comfort of ‘the community’.
149  inspired  by  William  Connolly’s  argument  that  identity  “requires  difference”  which  is  then  turned  into  (negative)  otherness  (Connolly  1991:  64).
Adopted  to the terminology used here, one would say that negative Othering is used as an anxiety  controlling mechanism.
The focus on the ‘negative Other’  is also dominant among scholars who see international  politics through a Schmittian lens, that is, who accept Carl Schmitt’s (1932) definition of  the  political  as  a  decision  identifying enemies  and  friends.
for   The Elusiveness o f ‘the Community’ The  view  that  desires  of belonging  and  recognition  drive  behaviour  is  found  among  scholars  exploring  ‘positive’  identification  and  the  formation  of social  or  ‘collective’  identity  (see  chapter  three).244  After  Mead,  the  social  dimension  of  Selfhood  was  captured  in  Erik  Erikson’s  notion  of ‘collective  identity’  and  has been  further explored  by social  psychologists,  most notably through the  development of social  identity theory  around  Henri  Tajfel,  who  argued  that  collective  identity  is  seen  as  “that  part  of  an  individual’s  self-concept  which  derives  from  his  knowledge  of  his  membership  in  a  social  group” (Tajfel  1978:  63).245 The  key argument coming out of this  research  is that  groups  make  individuals  ‘feel  good’  by  satisfying  desires  of  belonging.246  In  what  echoes Anderson’s  (1999) notion  o f ‘simultaneity’, the desire for  ‘belonging’  is  seen  as  expressing  the  Selfs  desire  to  have  access  to  stable  structures  of meaning and  thereby  provide cognitive-emotional  assurance.
Brubaker and  Cooper mention the  “emotionally  laden  sense  of belonging  to  a  distinctive,  bounded  group”  as  an  important  avenue  for  researchers  of the  formation  of  Selfhood  (Brubaker  and  Cooper  2000:  19).
For   A number of IR scholars have used these insights to argue that desires for belonging and  recognition  are  instance,  Larson  and  Shevchenko (2003) argue that Gorbachev’s new thinking was  a consequence of seeking  recognition  by  ‘the  West’  as  a  great  power,  Merje  Kuus  (2001)  shows  that  Estonian  security  discourse  in  the  1990s  and  the  question  of  NATO  membership  primarily  evolved  around  the  aim  of  becoming  a  member  of  ‘the  West’.
While  desires  for belonging and  recognition  can  be  read  as  expressions  of the  SelFs  desire to  tame anxiety by being with Others, the suggestion that these desires are satisfied through  ‘group membership’  or being part of a ‘community’ does not quite work as well when  it  comes to  satisfying a  desire  of authenticity.
One group of  scholars  speaks  of  “distinct  communities”  expressed  in  metaphorical  structures  of  ‘family  of nations’  (Brysk  et  al.,  2002:  268),  yet this  remains  vague  conceptually just  like Huntington’s notion of “kin-countries” (Huntington,  1993:  35).
An  understanding  of ‘the  West’  as  a  shared  project  must  not  necessarily  lead  to  a  falling  back  into  the  ‘group  membership’  narrative.
From  here  it is not far to Jonathan Mercer’s (1995) adaptation of social  identity theory, where  the  value  of  group  membership  is  reduced  to  winning  a  competition  against  another  group  and,  thus,  where  the  negative  Other  returns  in  form  of  an  ‘out-group’  as  the  decisive factor which keeps the ‘in-group’ together.
Interestingly,  one  place  is  Mead’s  discussion  of the  formation  of the  ‘M e’,  the  same  source  that  generated  the  quasi-consensus  among  scholars  that  the  social  element  of  Selfhood  is  provided  by  ‘community’  or  ‘group  membership’.
This  consensus  brushes  over Mead’s account of the  socialization  process  as one  emphasising two  stages:  in the  early  stage  of  development  the  Self  gains  particular  experiences  in  interaction  with  “significant others”, such as family members or friends, and only  in the second stage the  individual’s  identity  forms through  adaptation to the  larger community, which  he terms  the  “generalized  other”  (Mead  1934:  154),  which  blends  with  Heidegger’s  Man.
The  reason  why  the  crucial  role  of the  ‘significant  other’  in  the  self-fulfilment  process  has  been  ignored  by  scholars  can  be  explained  with  Mead  reducing  its  relevance to  a  mere  ‘first  phase’  or  ‘stage’  and  his  subsequent  argument  that  “the  essential  basis  and  prerequisite  of the  fullest  development”  occurs  through  the  adaptation  to  the  ‘general  Other’  (Ibid.).
The  next  step  is  to  conceptually  ground  such  relations  in  friendship  by  going  back to Aristotle.249  Aristotle:  Others as Selves  Friendship  is  a  central  theme  in  Aristotle’s  Nicomachean  Ethics  (NE),  which  is  still  considered  the  most  substantial  work  on  the  subject.250  For  Aristotle,  as  for  most  philosophers  in  ancient  Greece,  friends  are  an  essential  part of life,  “for  no  one  would  248 The definition of the ‘significant other’  is from  Hoelter (1984: 255).
254  For  Aristotle  virtue  is  about  finding  an  intermediate  between  excess  and  deficiency,  about  expressing  feelings  such  as  pity,  pleasure,  anger,  or pain  in  an  appropriate  and  measured  way.
154  and  a  sense  of  what  we  take  to  be  ultimately  good’,  they  also  develop  their  moral  capacities  together  over  time  (Sherman  1993:  97).
Any  return  that  is  made  “is  not  measured  by  money  and  no  equivalent  honour  can  be  paid;  but  it  is  enough  ...  to  do  what  we  can”  (NE,  Book  XI,  1).
More  precisely,  how  can they  be  inserted  into the  causal  narrative  seeking to  explain  government decisions  for  investing  in  international  security  institutions?
The  reading  of  true  friends  linked  by  an  organic  bond  merging  Self and  Other  is  similar to  what  Hannah  Arendt  calls  ‘fraternity’,  a  label  she  uses  for  relations  grounded  in  unconditional  love  and  characterised  by  closure  and  homogeneity.
In  IR  terminology,  it  requires  conceptualizing  friendship  between  states  through  the  ‘inter’  (of the  international).
institutions  managing   ‘inter’   the   is   filled  with   260  Arendt’s  discussion  of  ‘fraternity’  is  set  against  her  reading  of  friendship  as  involving  heterogeneity  and  potentially  global  (Chiba,  1995:  520).
Politics  for  her  is  about  managing  relations  and  thus  “develops  in  the  in-  between and manifests itself as the relation” (Arendt 2003: 9f.
Defining International Friendship  To begin with, friendships do not form  because of geographic proximity, economic ties,  or some kind of increased ‘interaction’.264 And while similar religions or similar political  systems  designate  broad  ideas  of order embedded  in  histories  and  visions  for the  good  life,  they  do  not  provide  sufficient  ground  for  friendship  bonds.
On  the  question  opinions  about what, the answer offered  here picks up the threads developed  in the discussion  so  far.265  In  basic  terms,  states  form  a  friendship through  a  shared  project of ‘world  building’  in  which their national  biographies are embedded.
Bonds of friendship develop through a shared experienced space and the  agreement of transforming  it  into  a  shared  envisioned  space  by  coming to  agree  on  an  idea of the  good order, that  is,  by agreeing on  lessons  from  significant experiences  and  how to translate them  into a common project lending significance to a shared future.
An  agreement of seeing the  ‘same world’  really is an agreement, and  is perhaps better understood as a commitment,  confirmed through practice, for an intimately shared world which both consider possible  and desirable.
Trust,  which  in  general  terms  is  about  “plac[ing]  the  fate  of ones  interest  under the  control  of others”  (Hoffman  2006:  17),  is  fundamentally  about  the  future,  about  expectations  that  my  becoming  is  taken  into  account  “in  some  relevant  way”.266  As  Giddens  points  out,  trust  is  based  not  so  much  on  past  experiences,  let  alone  subject  to  a  rational  decision-making  process,  but  presumes  “a  leap  to  commitment,  a  quality  of  ‘faith’  which  is  irreducible”  (Giddens  1991:  19).
Friends  trust  each  other  because  the  shared  vision  which  aligns  horizons  of  expectations  is  not  controlled by one or the other but produced together.
Here  it  is  important to  note  that the  exclusiveness  of friendship  does  not  require  falling  into  a  Schmittian  reading  of politics  as  making  the  distinction  between  friends  and  enemies,  a  reading  which  inevitably  produces  a  black-and-white  reading  of  the  international  (Behnke  2004).
Consequently,  the  argument  made  here  goes  against  the  view  that  a  stable  sense  of  Self  requires  both  an  Other  the  Self  identifies  with  (the  ‘friend’) and one it identifies against (the  ‘enemy’), as in Zygmunt Baumann’s assertion  that “building and keeping order means making friends and fighting enemies” (Baumann  1991:  24).
In  other words, the  power at work  here  is productive  (power-to)  rather than  coercive  (power-over).
As Marilyn Friedman notes,  162  “the  experiences,  projects,  and  dreams  of our  friends  can  frame  for  us  new  standpoints  from  which  we  can  experience  the  significance  and  worth  of moral  values  and  standards.
In  friendship,  our  commitment to  our  friends,  as  such,  afford  us  access  to  whole  ranges  of  experience  beyond our own” (Friedman  1993:  197).
This  learning process  requires,  obviously, that friends are willing to  share concerns  and  to  listen,  that  they  are  open  for  learning  and  moral  growth.
in  response   The  empowerment  process,  expressed  in  the  pursuit  of  a  common  project,  affects  international  order  at  large.
The  application  of a  double  standard  may  not  merely exclude  ‘third parties’  from decisions and  leave them  in the dark about the  ‘real’  reasons for doing X  or Y,267 the decisions taken  may be very well  directed against third  parties.
163  society (Hutter  1978;  Allan  1989) can  be applied to the  international  level and  supports  Biially  Mattem’s  suggestion  that  special  relationships  are  sources  of international  order  (Bially Mattem 2005a).
In the  domestic  setting  institutions  vary  with  the  political  system,  and  in  most  societies  they  encompass  a  complex  setting  in  which  political  parties,  parliament,  courts,  the  media,  and other public and private  sector groups debate the national biography on the basis of  a  formal  constitution.
While these  ‘domestic’  institutions  may also  organize themselves  across  formal  borders,  thus  thickening  the  transnational  space  on  the  level  ‘below’  the  government,  focus  here  is  on  how  government  representatives  negotiate  the  shared  project through formal  international  institutions.
More precisely, the argument is that states do so primarily through  international  security  institutions.
To  be  sure,  what  is ontologically  secure, that is,  what provides the national  biography  with  a  sense  of coherence  and  authenticity,  may  well  include  ideas  about  economic  order.
Thus,  the  logic  of  the  causal  narrative  presented  here  does  not  necessarily  limit  institutions  to  those  formally  in  charge  of  ‘security’.
Moreover,  it  could  be  argued  that  security  institutions  are  concerned with the use of force, and the definition of what accounts for a legitimate use  of force, central to Weber’s definition of the state, is a key element of ideas of the ‘good’  order inscribed  in national biographies.
Even in that case, security institutions,  including  those  often  described  as  military  alliances  such  as  NATO,  are  understood  here  as  political  platforms  through  which  the  very  meaning  of  ‘security’  for  the  Self and  its  268 Or what Harald  Mueller (2004) has called a “two-level discourse”,  although 1 shy away from  using  the  term  ‘discourse’  to  avoid  the  impression  that  shared  world  building  is  a  purely  rhetorical exercise.
As  such,  the  function  of  institutions  is  different  from  the  realist  reading  of stabilizing  a  certain  distribution  of  economic/military ‘power’, and from the institutionalist reading of mediating anarchy by  providing reliable information for members with pre-existing common interests.
They are, in short, vehicles for shared  ‘world building’.269  To  a  degree,  the  purpose  of  international  institutions  to  facilitate  the  convergence  of  horizons  of experience  and  expectations  encompasses  Krasner’s  (1983:  2)  definition  of  institutions  as  “principles,  norms,  rules,  and  decision-making  procedures  around  which  actor’s  expectations  converge  in  a  given  area”.
165  In sum, the purpose of institutions  is both  symbolic and  practical,  serving as forums for  negotiations  and  as  a frame  for common  (expected) practices,  providing  friends  with  a  space  for  devising  a  shared  utopia  and  enabling  them  to  confirm  their  commitment  through  co-operation.
An  institution  through  which  this  is  achieved,  that  is,  through  which friends can weave together their national biographies in a shared project, through  which  a  valued  space  can  be  imagined  and  moved  towards,  satisfies  their  respective  ‘national  security  interest’.
166  CHAPTER SEVEN:  PROCESSES OF ESTRANGEMENT AND  EMANCIPATION  Summary The  previous  chapter  argued  that  states  invest  in  common  security  institutions  for  the  purpose  of controlling  anxiety  through  common  ‘world  building’  project  with  friends.
It  suggests  that  they  do  so  when  the  existing  institutional  arrangement  and  the  friendship  sustained  through  it  ceases  to  function  as  an  anxiety  controlling mechanism.
The  chapter concludes with  some guiding thoughts on  what can  be  expected  when  applying  the causal  narrative  developed thus  far to the  empirical  study of the  German-American  relationship.
In the theoretical frame developed here,  it means  the institution  has become  inadequate  in providing  ‘ontological  security’  in the sense of  enabling the Self to construct and ‘live’ (formulate and practice) a coherent biographical  167  ‘inadequate’  consequently   narrative  inscribing meaning into time and space through a project devised with friends.
Said  differently,  to  understand  what makes an  existing  institutional arrangement inadequate requires a better understanding of what generates a  feeling  of ontological  insecurity,  that  is,  what  poses  an  ‘existential  threat’  to  a  stable  sense of Self generated within friendship.
requires   taking  a  closer   Although  there  are  some  useful  hints,  IR  scholarship  fares  poorly  when  it  comes  to  conceptualizing  the  threat  to  socially  constructed  ‘identities’  and  specifying  how  it  emerges  among  states.
The  initial  group  of  moderate  constructivists  dealt  with  the  ‘existential  threat’  in  two  ways,  both  of which  end  up  with  an  argument where  such  a  threat  has  disappeared.
The  first  does  so  deliberately  and  is  most  apparent  in  Wendt’s  work.
Like  Wendt’s  Kantian  cultures,  security  communities  are  marked  by  expectations  of peaceful  co-existence  amongst  its  members;  yet  in  contrast  to  Wendt  these  works  also  rely  an  ‘ingroup’  versus  ‘outgroup’  dynamic  to  explain  how  states  come  to  share  a  collective  identity.
immoral  and   Two  recent  works  exploring  the  socio-linguistic  ties  of the  Anglo-American  ‘special  relationship’  by Steele (2005) and Bially Mattem (2005b) offer some promising hints for  conceptualising  ontological  insecurity.
In  short,  the  decision  not to  intervene was thus  made to  avert a  threat  to  British  ontological  security  (Steele  2005:  523,  538).
According  to  Mattem,  mutual  accusations of violating shared values/norms fundamental to the Western order in which  American  and  British  narratives  of  national  Selfhood  were  embedded  generated  “episteifiological  disorder” and, thus, threatened ontological  security on  both  sides.
Hence,  to  “secure  identity  in  its  truth”  and  keep  difference  at  bay,  everything that  appears  ‘different’  is  fixed  as  the  enemy  ‘Other’  and  degraded to  an  inferior status.
This theme is visible especially  in his later writings on the impact of technology (Dreyfus, 2006:  361).
As  discussed  in  chapter  five,  any  substantial  vision  of the  future  is  a  projection  providing  the  Self with  a  meaningful  reference  and  serving  as  an  anxiety  controlling  mechanism.
For  there  to  be  a  conceivable  ‘threat’,  the  Self  must  be  in  a  state  of  ontological  security  and,  hence,  must  already  have  identified  its  ‘Other’,  which  in  Connolly’s version  is the  ‘enemy’.
While  Erikson  developed  the  notion of an  identity crisis to describe crises of adolescence, it has since been used more  generally  to  describe  a  Self suffering  from  “massive  dislocations”  (Straub,  2002:  62),  “an  acute  form  of  disorientation”  (Taylor,  1989:  27).
It  is  a  person  who  simultaneously  is  and  is  not  part  of a  ‘familiar  setting’,  whose  position  within  a  group  is  “determined...by  the  fact  that  he  has  not  belonged  to  it  from  the  beginning,  that  he  imports  qualities  into  it  which  do  not  and  cannot  stem  from  the  group  itself’ (Ibid.).
The  unique  feature  of the  stranger  is that “it  embodies that  synthesis  of nearness  and  distance”  and  is  thus  someone who  is  in  close  contact but not “organically connected” (Ibid, 404).
One can develop  two  slightly  different  conceptualizations  of the  stranger  out  of  Simmel’s  discussion,  namely the  ‘newcomer’  and the  ‘marginal’  (Mclemore,  1970).
He  describes  the destabilizing atmosphere surrounding the appearance of the stranger is stark colours:  “the arrival of a Stranger has the impact of an earthquake.. .the Stranger shatters the rock  on which the  security of daily  life rests” (Baumann  1991  or  1997:  10).
Whereas the  familiar stranger is  a  being the  Self does  not  feel  emotionally  close to,  the  argument  is  that in order to pose a threat to ontological security, ‘the stranger’  lacks this distance.
in  which   its   flip   relationship   interdependence  exposes   The  social  capital  contained  in  friendship,  namely  the  ability  to  provide  stability  by  mutually  satisfying  desires  of belonging/recognition  and  authenticity,  turns  into  a  sofit-  power  side,  namely  vulnerability.274  In  the  process  of developing  ideas  of order  /  a  shared  a  moral  space  together by collaborating on making sense of the past and planning for the future, friends  tame  their  anxiety  by  coming  to  share  intimate  knowledge,  and  this  intimacy  implies  great vulnerability.
They  suggested  that  international  regimes  function  as  intervening  factors  through  which  interdependence  among  states is channeled and shows its effects.
The  possibility  of  the  friend-tuming-stranger  and,  hence,  the  inherent  ability  of  the  friend  to  significantly  destabilize the national  biography  is  always  ‘present’,  so  that the  feeling of a  loss of identity  is “a threat against which no one can  be completely  secure”  (Straub 2002:  62).275 And  if the friend plays a key role  in enabling authentic becoming,  then  its  ‘disappearance’,  the  process  of the  friend  turning  into  a  stranger,  poses  the  greatest threat to  the  same.
Simmel  argued  that  even  if  one  can  never  know  the  other  absolutely,  “one  forms  some  personal  unity  out  of those  fragments  in  which  alone  [the  other]  is  accessible  to  us”  (Simmel  1950:  308,  326).
This opens up the issue of multiple friendships..  180  unwanted  separation282  expresses,  more  precisely,  the  disconnect  of  horizons  of  expectation  and  experience  which  had  previously  lend  coherence  to  the  biographical  narrative developed together with  the  significant Other.
Fear of alienation  is the  fear of  ‘loosing’  this  narrative  and  requires  finding  a  way  to  reduce  the  tension  between  the  desires of recognition/belonging and the desire for authenticity.283  Preventing Alienation: Adaptation and Emancipation  Estrangement  does  not  happen  overnight but  is  a  gradual  process  in  which  the  parties  have  the  opportunity  to  counter  an  in  ambivalence  and  alienation  by  renegotiating  the  shared  project.
As research in sociology  shows,  one  of the  most  important  measures to  ‘rescue’  friendships  is  ‘communication’  (Fehr  1996;  see  also  Bially  Mattem  2005b).
However,  even  a  Habermasian  discourse  ethics  requires  a  common  ‘lifeworld’,  which  is  to  say  that  communication  reaches  its  limits when  friends  grow dissimilar in virtue, that is,  when they  start to diverge  in their  views over what  is the  desirable  ‘good’  order.
It  is  different  from  the  second  meaning  of  ‘alienation’  prevalent among social  contract scholars who put forward the  idea of a  limited transfer of rights  to the  sovereign  in  exchange of security (Der Derian,  1987:  15-19;  Olsen  1969:  291 f>-  See  also  Dean (1961).
Their  success  depends  on  the  both  the  willingness  of the  friend  to  compromise  and  on  the  depth  of  required  changes  of the  national  biography.
In this  situation  of instability,  where  the  familiar world  is  fading  away  and  where  its  restoration  requires  one  or  both  sides  to  adapt,  that  states  will  in  which  the  willingness  to  make  voluntary  compromises   in  a  downward-spiral:  dissonance  emerging  due   to  a   182  into  focus,  yet  this   ’Soft  power’  moves  back   attempt to  exert pressure on  the  significant Other to  adapt.
Emancipation  If the state finds itself in a position where the significant Other is unwilling to reduce its  expectations  and  where  it  thinks  its  voice  is  not  sufficiently  taken  into  account  in  the  process of world building,285 and  if adaptation is perceived to require an alteration of the  national  biography  by  pushing  it  beyond  what James  Rosenau  (1981)  calls  “acceptable  limits”  that  would  lead  to  a  loss  of  authenticity,  the  state  will  pursue  a  strategy  of  emancipation.
183  requires a ‘dimension of ground’ to stand on.
The  tension  Laclau  identifies,  also  captured in the paradox that, given the anxiety controlling function of friendship, friends  should  never  allow  their  relationship  to  dissolve  in  the  first  place,  rests  on  the  understanding  that  the  sense  of Self is  constituted  in  relation  with  the  Other  and  that  breaking with this relationship means it desires to become something else, the possibility  of which  it  presumably has  learned  outside  this relationship.
The  question  is,  once  again,  how  to  think  about  this  ‘ground’  on  which  Selfhood  stands,  how  the  internal/personal  (domestic)  and  the  external/social  (international) dimensions of Selfhood relate.
While  in  this  process  the  biographical  narrative  also  will  also  undergo  change,  the  adaptation required will  be more attractive if the  Self has more influence  in determining  the direction these changes take.
Applying the Lens:  Looking Ahead  With  the  causal  narrative  completed  in  the  abstract,  the  task  ahead  is  to  apply  the  theoretical frame developed thus far to the dynamic of German-American cooperation as  captured at the outset: (i) the consensus that NATO was the institution most desirable for  dealing with  ‘European  security’  in  the  post-WW  II  decade (1945-55),  (ii) the  tensions  between  Bonn  and  Washington  over  the  usefulness  of CSCE  in  the  ‘detente’  decade  (1965-75),  and  (iii)  the  divergence  over  institutional  preferences  for  the  purpose  of  ‘European  security’  in  the  decade  surrounding  the  end  of  the  Cold  War  (1985-95)  signified  by  German  investment  in  CFSP  as  an  institution  which  excluded the  US.
The  empirical  analysis  first  needs  to  identify  the  parameters  of the  ‘national  security  interest’  on each  side to then determine the presence or absence of a  ‘common’  security  interest.
Rather than  engaging  military-strategic  thinking  about  force  structures  among  the  military  establishment, the theoretical  lens  applied  here  understands  security  policy  as being about creating and  maintaining order within a national  biography and to assess  the  overlap  between  German  and  American  conceptions  of the  same.
This  provides the  basis  on  which  the  usefulness  (or  value)  of  a  security  institution  is  evaluated  and,  consequently,  the  investment or  lack thereof in  a common  institution  can  be explained.
As the  formation and  weakening of friendship  bonds -  the emergence of resonance and  dissonance  in  national  biographies  and  the  success  or  failure  in  negotiating  a  shared  project -   and  the  corresponding  investment  in  international  institutions  takes  time,  the  empirical analysis spans three ten-year periods.
As noted in the introduction, the phenomenological lens on the development of ‘national  biographies’  requires a hermeneutical  approach.
It  requires  analytical  empathy and  seeks to offer a deliberately uncritical  reconstruction  of how these  leaders  represented Germany’s or America’s ‘being-in-the-world’.
The first concerns  identifying feelings of  anxiety and,  in an attempt to control the same, desires for belonging/recognition and  for  authenticity  expressed  by  political  leaders  and  the  broader  community  they  represent.
While the empirical analysis must provide some indication that these feelings are present  and  drive  decisions/behaviour,  this  requires  some  interpretative  sensitivity/freedom  as  these feelings are rarely shown in public or voiced in these terms.
Such  a  parallel  analysis  is omitted  here,  as  it would  either blow the third  part out of proportion  or come at a cost of a more detailed understanding of the dynamics in German-American  relations.287  287 The omission  is compensated for by the  fact that the development of intimate bonds between  Bonn and Paris is well documented in the literature and can be referenced where appropriate.
Echoing  the  view  that  German-American  security  cooperation  was  not  based  on  a  military  rationale  but about „wrapping political  problems of an  entirely different  kind”  (Krieger  in  Schwabe  1994:  47),288 the chapter assesses the  explanatory  power of the  ‘friendship’  argument  developed  over  the  previous  chapters.
Capturing  his  anxiety  of not  being  able  to  control  Germany’s  future  in  the  ‘Potsdam  complex’,  it  is  shown  how  Adenauer  projected  Germany  into  the  Western  space  and  located  the  US  as  a  friend.
Reinventing ‘Germany’ The  end  of the  war  required  the  reinvention  of  ‘Germany’.
The  shadow  government  was  dissolved  by  the  Allies  in  late  May  and  a  week  later,  on  5  June  1945,  the  Allied  Control  Council  proclaimed  supreme  authority.
Thus,  in the summer of 1945,  political  leaders had to find a new answer to the  ‘German  question’  by  recreating  a  narrative  of Germany-in-the-world.290  In  addition  to  physical  reconstruction, the renewal of Germany as a country, a society, a participant in the world  required  an  narrative  which  dealt  with  the  memories  and  redefined  the  vision  towards  which  a post-war  ‘Germany’  could  unfold.
It required  an  answer to  what Verheyen  (1991)  calls  the  two  faces  of the  ‘German  question’,  an  internal  and  an  external  one:  how  to  reconstruct  a  Germany  its  citizens  would  want to  live  in  and  one  which  others  would  agree to live with.
What was  initially envisioned  as  a  central  administrative  ‘European’  organ  for  occupied  Germany  was  turned  into  a  fractioned authority without much coordination; that is,  fragmented not only  in terms of  location,  but  also  in  the  directives  it  was  to  install  (Mai  1994).
Beyond  a  general  agreement  to  set  up  measures  preventing  future  German  aggression  and  extracting  reparation  payments  as  outlined  in  the  Potsdam  Agreement,  captured  under  the  objectives  of  demilitarization,  denazification,  and  decartellisation  (which  basically  meant  destroying  German  war  industry),  the  Allies’  ideas  about  what  to  do  with  Germany after Hitler were “neither specific nor compatible” (Pulzer  1995:  24).
Or  was  the  rise  of  Nazism  caused  by  structural  economic  inequality  and  the  work  of  capitalist  elites?
Into  this  ‘vacuum’,  German  political  life  developed  rather  quickly.
The  first  two  post­ war years  saw  a  fast  development of political  institutions  and,  within  them,  an  intense  domestic debate  about the  direction  the  ‘new’  Germany  should  take  (Pulzer  1995:  32).
These  personalities  had  strong  views over what had gone wrong and were eager to  ‘correct’  the German path and were  able  to  reactivate  structures  of party  organization  deeply  rooted  in  Germany’s  political  tradition.
The second group,  represented  by  the  SPD  under  the  leadership  of  Kurt  Schumacher,  appeared  to  be  predestined  to  politically  dominate  the  ‘new’  Germany  due  to  its  strong  democratic  tradition,  its  institutional  base  and  the  fact that  it was the  only  one  of the  major parties  which had opposed  Hitler’s rise and paid the costs.
However,  Schumacher and  his  SPD  lost  the  leadership  position  to  the  third  group  around  Konrad  Adenauer  and  the  newly  created  Christian  Democratic Union  (CDU), who won the  1949  election  by one vote  in  coalition with the Bavarian sister party (CSU) and the  Liberal  Party  (FDP) and  was  re­ elected in  1953 by a wide margin.
Adenauer’s  rise  and  his  success  in  claiming  the  political  leadership  in  the  Western  occupied  zones  has  been  comprehensively  discussed  by  historians  like  Hans-Peter  Schwarz (1986).292  A  seasoned  politician  who  had  experienced the  occupation  after the  First World War as mayor of Cologne, Adenauer reemerged as the chairman of the CDU  in the British zone and, after holding multiple offices,  including of the assembly writing  291  For a detailed discussion of the FRG’s domestic debate on security issues involving all parties  and interest groups, see Volkmann (1990).
According  to  his  biographers,  including  his  long-term  assistant,  Adenauer  was  convinced  that  political  practice  must  be  guided  by  basic  principles  (Grundsatze)  and  long trajectories  or tendencies  (Entwicklungstendenzen).296  In  his  memoirs  Adenauer  wrote  that  fate  was  determined  by  “big  ideas”  and  “ethical  foundations”  and  defined  politics  as  the  art  to  realize  over  the  long  term  what  was  recognized as morally right (in  Poppinga  1975:  13).
Instead,  it  was  his  anxiety  of not  being  able  to  influence  what  Germany  would  become  and,  thus,  of not  being  able  to  ‘see’  Germany’s  future  because  of the  ever-present possibility of a  revival  of the  Allied  control  council  and  its  claim  to  supreme  authority,  that  is,  ‘another  Potsdam’  (Grewe  1960:  57).299  Said  differently, he was anxious about Fremdbestimmung, the possibility that the direction of  the  ‘new’  Germany  would  be  determined  by  others  he  could  not  meaningfully  communicate with and/or which would not listen to him.
While  the  Russians  seemed  determined  in  creating  their  idea  of  order  in  the  Eastern  zone,  Adenauer  repeatedly  complained  about  discriminatory  practices  and  about  chaos  in  planning  and  administration  in the Western  sectors, calling it a “verhaegnisvolles Durcheinander” (in  Schwarz  1986:  443-447;  Foschepoth  1997).
His  conviction  that  ‘Germany’  needed to be developed  with someone was a core theme reflected  in  his  gloomy  predictions  of what  would  happen  if Germany  became  ‘neutral’.
Sorting the Memory Space The  formulation  of a  ‘new’  German  narrative  required  connecting  past  (memory)  and  future (visions).
Adenauer’s  task  “to  form  a  new  state  out  of the Konkursmasse  of the  Reich”  (Foschepoth  1988:  40)  was  to  use the  memory  space  the  war  had  created  in  a  way  that  signalled  a  break  with  the  Third  Reich  and  satisfied domestic and international audiences.
In the German  case,  the  ‘legacy  of militarism’  stood  not  only  for  aggressive  foreign  policy  but  for  a  way  of  organizing  society,  that  is,  as  a  principle  of  domestic  order.
Developed in the  19th century and popular in the  ‘Pan European’  movement in the  1920s  this  vision  had  lived  on  during the  war  in  the  resistance  and  among exiles.309  After the  end of the war,  Adenauer participated  in meetings reviving the federal  idea of a ‘United  States  of Europe’  and  adopted  it  as  a  promising  design,  endorsing  it  in  his  Cologne  speech in  1946 a few months before Churchill famously did so in Zurich.310  308  This  overlapped  with  the  Allied  objective,  as  Eisenhower  put  it,  to  educate  Germans  to  the  “self-evident truth” that war was “immoral” (in Jarausch 2004: 41).

Adenauer was  also  sensitive to the  fact that  reinventing  Germany-in-  Europe  required  redefining  the  relationship  with  France.
The  Brussels  agreement thus  lacked  a decisive  promise that the  space  negotiated  through  them  was  to  include  Germany  in  positive  terms,  it  certainly  did  not  cater  to  Adenauer’s  vision  of  recreating  a  Germany  at  the  ‘heart’  of  Europe.
While until late  1948 Adenauer had little knowledge  about  the  workings  of  US  politics  and  had  difficulties  grasping  its  direction,  he  recognised the US potential  for the renewal o f ‘Germany-in-Europe’  early on (Schroder  1988:  123).316 In March  1946 Adenauer wrote a colleague in the US to help convince the  government “that the  rescue  of Europe  can  only  succeed  with  help  from  the  USA”  and  that  such  a  rescue  would  also  be  “elementary”  [wesentlich]  for the  US  (Schwarz  1986:  564).
While  reminding Germans that  they  were bearing the responsibility for their current situation, he closed his speech by saying  “the  United  States  has  no  desire to  increase  those  hardships  or to  deny  the  German  people  an  opportunity  to  work  their  way  out  of  those  hardships (...) The American people want to help the German people to  win  their  way  back  to  an  honorable  place  among  the  free  and  peace-  loving nations of the world”.318  The  speech  was  received  very  positively,  with  German  newspapers  commenting  that  Byrnes  had  opened  a  “door  of  hope”  through  which  “a  friend  and  helper  showed  Germans  the  way  to  a  new  life”  (cited  in  Jarausch  2004:  150).
By  the  time  Marshall  noted  in  June  1947  that  the  US  was  “one  of the  bulwarks of Western  civilization” and would not “stand  by and  watch the disintegration  of the  international  community to which  we belong” (in Jackson, 2003:  244), the future  of ‘Europe’  had become central to the future of the Western space.
Yet  from  a  phenomenological  perspective  the  American  motivation for becoming engaged  in  Europe was not merely to create a  ‘zone of peace’  (McArdle  Kelleher,  1983),  but  a particular  peace,  one  which  provided  the  US  with  authentic  ontological  security.
The  point  made  here  is  that,  in  contrast  to  explanations  stressing  pure  economic  motives  (securing  a  new  market)  or  a  traditional  security  rationale  (deterrence  against  Soviet  aggression),  from  a  national  biography  perspective  (Coker  1998: 32).
From that perspective, the geopolitical argument why Europe  mattered  popular  among  strategic  analysts  at  the  time,  building  on  the  conviction  that  “who rules Eurasia controls the destinies of the world” (see Leffler,  1984:  fn  30),322 was  informed  less  by  a  realist  (balance  of power)  mindset  than  by  the  view  that  a  strong  Europe  within  the  West  would  vitalize  America’s  vision  for  and  unfolding  in  ‘the  world’.323  The  aim  was to  integrate  Europe  for a creative  project which  accommodated  American  ideas  of  order  and  was  supported  by  European  nations  thereby  satisfying  desires of both  belonging/recognition  and  authenticity.
Yet  whereas  the  Chancellor’s  support for this design is well known, the American position requires some elaboration.
In  addition  to  the  paramount theme  of creating  ‘peace  through freedom ’  present  in  all  322 For a comprehensive revisionist discussion of the American  ‘national security interest’  at the  time,  including the view prevailing among strategists that “any power(s) attempting to dominate  Eurasia must be regarded as potentially hostile to the United States”, see Leffler (1984: 456ff.).
In  Washington  the  idea  of  a  ‘unified’  Europe  was  discussed  already  during the war, with reports on how to best organize economic aid highlighting a region-  specific  design  with  Germany  at  the  centre  (Winand  1993:  7-14).
Like  Adenauer,  US  planners  and  policymakers  were  exposed  to  the  idea  by  advocates  of  a  European  federation,  including Monnet.324 The  idea of a  ‘United  States of Europe’  was prominent  also  in  the  State  Department  and  favourably  debated  in  the  press  and  on  Capitol  Hill  through  groups  such the  ‘American  Committee for a Free  and  United  Europe’  (Winand  1994:  19ff).
After initial concerns that such an approach would compromise the idea of  free  trade,  the  Truman  administration  since  late  1945  set  course  for  the  economic  reconstruction o f ‘Europe’  and developed institutions were not just to distribute aid most  efficiently,  but  to  install  the  kind  of European  order  of  ‘freedom’  and  ‘unity’  the  US  deemed worth investing in.325  Rather  than  dismissing  the  popularity  of the  ‘United  States  of Europe’  vision  as  mere  rhetoric,  as  Kaplan  (1984;  1994)  seems  to  suggest,  the  argument  here  is  that  it  was  fundamental  for  how  Washington  rationalized  and justified  its  engagement  in/with  the  European  space.
As noted earlier, Hitler’s policies connected the two  in the experience of the  participants  and  victims  in  that  war  and  rendered  it  impossible  to  conceive  of  one  (‘Europe’)  without  the  other  (‘Germany’).327  Thus,  the  task  of  ordering  Europe  inevitably included the task of ordering Germany.
As Tony Judt points out, 85 percent of  American  war  effort  had  gone  on  the  war against  Germany  (Judt  2005:  105)  and  so  it  was not the ‘Soviet question’  but the ‘German question’  which stood at the centre of US  post-war planning and informed the broader question how to order ‘Europe’:  “the central  question  of  the  postwar  world  was  and  would  remain  the  future  of  Germany”  (McAllister 2002: 4).
Proposals  such  as  those  advanced  by  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  Henry  Morgenthau  which  recommended  stripping  Germany  of  its  industrial  capacity  and  turning  it  de facto  into  an  agricultural  society  were  discarded.
Although  Roosevelt initially leaned towards German punishment,  in  September  1944 he distanced  himself from  the  Morgenthau  Plan  in  the  face  of opposition  from  Congress,  the  press  and  such  measures  were  counterproductive for achieving Tasting peace’  in Europe.
Directive  1067 from the Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff,  presented  to  Truman  in  April  1945  calling  for  treating  occupied  Germany  as  “a  defeated  enemy  nation”  faced  similar  criticism  and  faded  in  the  implementation  phase  (Winand,  1993:  7;  Judt  2005:  105).
From  Byrnes’  speech  to  the  Marshall  Plan  to  Acheson’s  note that the US was “giving the Germans a goal to work as  partners with other Western  countries” (in  Kaplan  1984:  6),  US  policy towards  Germany  is  better captured  in terms  o f ‘recreation’.
When  Acheson  spoke  about  the  difference between the American,  French  and  British  policies on  post-war Germany,  he  noted “I suppose that it is a result of the depth of the historical background, the emotions  and the passions that have been aroused by Germany’ aggressive wars and the inevitable  importance  attached  to  the  course  of German  development”  (Acheson  1950:  118).
However,  the  administration  shared  with  Adenauer  the assessment that there was “a gap between the desirable and the practicable” (Gaddis  2005:  72f.).
The  fact  that  about  30%  of Americans  claimed  German  heritage,  making  it  the  largest  immigrant  group, in all  likelihood also contributed to the hope in a ‘better’  Germany.
Given  the  highly  militarized  environment  after  the  war  and  the  vivid  memories  of  German  aggression a new European order required an institution dealing with the question of the  legitimate  use  of force.
Rearmament as Voice Adenauer  was  convinced  that  German  participation  in  the  US  effort  of  shaping  the  Western  space  would  require  NATO  membership.
This  would  bring  recognition  as  an  ‘equal  partner’  entitled  and  expected  to  help  developing  Germany-in-Europe.
Neither  he  nor  Schumacher, who was an even stronger advocate of ‘sovereignty’, wanted a reduction of  military presence  of allied  forces  on  German territory,  quite the  opposite.332  And  while  Adenauer was  determined to end the  Occupation  Statute put  in  place  after the  founding  of the FRG  in  1949 (see below), this was because it kept open the possibility of ‘another  Potsdam’; Adenauer worked hard on tying the vision of a unified Germany to the course  of  Westintegration  and  European  unity.333  As  Hanrieder  observes,  the  sovereignty  for  which  Adenauer  aimed  was  “of  a  rather  special  kind:  once  obtained,  it  would  be  immediately  ‘dissipitated’  within  treaties  that  bound  Germany  to  the  West.
In  short,  the  sovereignty  Adenauer  wanted  did  not  refer  to  autonomy  but  to  having  a  voice  in  the  development  of Germany-in-(Westem)Europe.
It  allowed  him  to  link the  possibility  of German  participation  in  a  ‘European  army’  with  332 In  his security memorandum to the High  Commissioners from August  1950,  Adenauer called  for a reinforcement of occupying troops (Baring  1969:  86),  as did  Schumacher in his Bundestag  speech from November 1950 (Schumacher 1950).
While  measuring the  distribution  of ‘hard  power’  in  Europe  in  the  first  post-war years  is  notoriously  difficult,  on  the  basis  of conventional  indicators  the  US  clearly  outweighed  the  Soviet  Union.
During  the  war  it  had  only  215  suffered  a  fraction  of the  over  20  Million  Russians  lives  that  were  lost,334  and  while  Stalin  had  to  deal  with  heavily  damaged  cities,  industry  and  infrastructure,  the  US  economy  had  been  boosted  by  the  war.335  Most  importantly,  the  US  military  was  not  only  technologically  more  advanced  but  also  holding  the  monopoly  over  nuclear  weapons.336  Ikenberry’s note that the  pre-eminent position  of the  US  was  recognized  at  the time  is true  for the German  government, with  Adenauer in  October  1950  describing  the  US  in  the  Bundestag  as  the  most  powerful  actor  since  the  Roman  Empire  (in  Schroder  1988:  123).
This  argument  is  not  very  convincing,  however,  because  it  downplays  the  nuclear  advantage  and  does  not  provide  a  comparative  perspective,  without  which  ‘power’  cannot  be  measured.
Pointing to their nuclear arsenal and  superior  naval  power,  US  officials  informed  the  German  chancellor  that  they  believed  the likelihood of a Soviet invasion to be slim (Volkmann, 23 8f.
As noted earlier, the primary concern of the French was not the development of a  ‘new’  Germany  but  oppressing  the  ‘old’  and  familiar  one.
While  the  Pentagon  never  warmed  up  to  the  EDC   After  a  number  of  revisions  which  reduced  German  discriminatory  measures  in  the  French proposal and established a link to NATO, in  September  1951  the Allies agreed to  integrate  a  German  defense  contribution  in  a  European  Defense  Community  (EDC).347  The EDC proposal maintained Monnet’s idea to have the European Army established as  an  element  of  political  integration  running  parallel  to  and  eventually  merging  with  economic  idea,  Truman/Acheson  and  Eisenhower/Dulles  came  to  see  it  as  a  central  step  towards  securing the  FRGs commitment to West and establishment of a United  States of Europe  within  NATO’s  sight.
Privately  welcoming  the  ‘death’  of the  federal  utopia,  Churchill  and  Eden  saw  a  chance  to  revitalise  NATO  and,  with  French  approval,  worked  out  a  compromise which  paved the way for Germany  into NATO  via the  ‘Western  European  Union’  (WEU)  (Grewe  1960:  63f).
Conclusion Against  the  backdrop  of  a  reading  of  security  institutions  serving  the  purpose  of  negotiating  a  common  project  among  friends,  this  chapter  provided  evidence  for  the  argument that  German and  American  decision  makers  invested  in  NATO  because  they  considered  it  the  most  suitable  institution  through  which  they  could  transform  their  shared  experienced  space,  Europe,  into  a shared  envisioned  space.
This  chapter  focuses on Willy Brandt as the main figure representing the German narrative to offer an  explanation  for  his  motivation  to  invest  in  a  new  institution  for  ordering  ‘Europe’,  namely the Conference of Security and  Cooperation  in  Europe (CSCE)  in which the US  was  reluctant to  participate.350  Applying the  estrangement lens  developed  earlier,  I  seek  to  explain  this  in  terms  of a  divergence  between  German  and  American  narratives  of  authentic  becoming,  specifically  with  an  emerging  dissonance  about  a  desirable  vision  (utopia)  for  European  order.
To  substantiate  this  argument,  the  chapter  traces  the  narratives  of ‘Germany’  and  ‘America’  in-the-world  as  formulated  by  Brandt/Bahr (on  the  German  side) and Johnson  and Nixon/Kissinger (on the  US  side)  between  1965  and  1975, with particular attention given to their visions of ‘peace  in Europe’  and how these  informed evaluations of NATO and CSCE.
While  less cunning than  Adenauer  in  day-to-day  practice,  he  shared  the  old  Chancellor’s  thinking  in  long  term  processes  and  his  evolutionary  understanding  of  politics,  the  fixing  a  greater  vision  gradually  approached  through  ‘politics  of small  steps’  (Mann  1971:  15-20).
Nobody  will  stop  this development” (Brandt,  1971:  77)  Here  the  second  major  departure  from  Adenauer’s  course  emerges.
This  crucial  and  most  controversial  spatial  extension  of  Germany-in-Europe,  which  informed  his  Ostpolitik,  was  formed  significantly  through  Brandt’s experience of living in Berlin.
Thus,  in a speech to the  Bundestag in November  1970 he stressed the importance of including the  ‘East’  into the  future  of Europe,  warning  of an  internal  contradiction  when  “if we  conjure  the  future  (only) to the West and the past (only) to the East” (Brandt,  1976:  331).359  That  said,  Brandt’s  vision  of  Greater  Europe  remained  situated  within  the  Western  space.
Ostpolitik was driven by Brandt’s conviction that the division of Germany-in-Europe did  not  constitute  a  state  of  peace  and  that  building  Germany-in-Europe  required  a  transformation  of the  status  quo  (the  order of Yalta).
The  result  was  the  recognition that neighbours needed to feel so secure from  ‘Germany’ that they would not  be  afraid  of  its  unification,  which  lead  to  the  subsequent  question  of  how  ‘Europe’  would have to be organised to provide security not only for and but also from  Germany  (Bahr  1996:  226).
While  Brandt/the  Social  Democrats  rejected  the  communism  as  a  desirable  order,361  formally expressed  in  the  1959  Godesberger Program, they  did  not consider  it  an  alien  the  SPD’s  (and  Brandt’s)  disagreement  with  communism  was  anchored  on  a  different  level,  namely  in  the  translation  of socialist  principles  into  political  practice.
This  strategy  of using each other for locating and disposing of the  ‘bad’  memories of the Third Reich  worked well  as  long  as there  were  two  ‘Germany’s’.
This  conviction  lead  Brandt  to  apologise  to  the  Czechoslovak  nation  that  the  GDR  had  participated  in  the  1968  occupation,  as  well  as  his  more  well-known  (and  more  symbolically profound)  gesture  of kneeling  in  front of the  Warsaw-Ghetto  memorial  in  December  1970.363  Redefining Germany-in-Europe thus required re-engaging the memory space created by  the Third  Reich  and  disseminating the  new vision  of (Germany  in)  a Greater European  Peace  Order.
As  soon  as  he  became  Chancellor,  the  talks  were  intensified  and,  in  a  remarkable  speed  the  Brandt  government  negotiated  and  signed  treaties  with  Moscow  (1970),  Warsaw  (1970),  and  the  GDR  (1972).364  Two  crucial  elements  were  required,  however, to turn this  into an enduring project within the  Western  space.
First,  it needed  in  Eastern  Europe,  mainly  through   talks  on   362 That Brandt’s vision was appreciated in Eastern Europe is suggested by Jiri Dienstbier, one of  the  most  prominent  dissidents  in  Czechoslovakia  in  the  1970s  and  80s,  who  prefaced  his  book  entitled “Dreaming of Europe’  with the note that in thinking about the goal how to overcome the  order of Yalta,  Brandt’s Ostpolitik was the only larger conception developed in the West “which  reckoned with  a  Europe  other than the  one  to  which  we had  all  accustomed ourselves”  (in  Ash  1993:  15).
It  required  navigating  between  the  French  desire  to  build  a  Europe  independent  from  the  US  and  one  in  which  ‘Germany’  was  not  getting  too  strong  (Hoffmann  1964,  Bozo  2001).
On  the  other side,  de  Gaulle was  one  of the  early protagonists  of ‘detente’  and  had  loosely  advocated the  creation  of a European  security  system  ‘from  the  Atlantic to the  Ural’  in  the  early  1960s.
Brandt’s perception  of Kennedy as  a representative of a courageous  America promising  a  better  future  was  echoed  in  Kennedy’s  simultaneous  toning  down  of  the  anti­ communist position and advocacy an ‘activist’ or ‘transformative’ approach towards ‘the  East’.369 After the Cuban missile crisis Kennedy chose a course of peaceful  engagement  in  which  efforts  to  reduce tensions  with  Moscow through  negotiations  on  arms  control  were  coupled  with  establishing  trade  relations  with  East  European  states  intended  to  367 See Kennedy (1962).
368  Yet  he  also  knew  that  to  be  considered  equal,  the  US  expected  Europeans  to work  closer together.
This  concerned,  in  particular,  Kennedy’s  view  on  the  necessity of recognising the  ‘status quo’, which  stood  in tension with his transformative  outlook and  required  some adjustment on  Brandt’s  side  (Hofmann  2006:  440).
the  dissonance  Brandt  experienced  with   tension   is   indicative  of   The ‘Berlin Complex’ Even  after  the  termination  of the  occupation  statute,  the  Western  powers  continued  to  hold  some  formal  and  informal  authority  in the  FRG,  in  particular when  it  came to  the  use  of the  Bundeswehr.
For Brandt,  who  as  noted  earlier  lived  in  the  city  for  two  decades  after  the  war,  including  as  mayor,  the  Potsdam  complex  became  the  ‘Berlin  complex’,  the  concern  that  negotiations  between  Washington  and  Moscow  affecting  European  order  were  bypassing  Bonn  and  that  the  two  sides  would  come  to  an  agreement  detrimental  to  the  vision  of having  Germany  unified  in a Greater Europe.
Changing the  status quo would  require  a war which,  Kennedy noted,  was  in  no-ones’  interest  (Bahr  1996:  136).
By  attributing  this  dialectic  to  Kennedy,  Brandt  not  only  skilfully  reconciled  the  tension  between  (i)  accepting the  status  quo,  including the  GDR,  which  meant the  death  of the  Hallstein  doctrine371  and  was  widely  seen  as  undermining the  idea that  there  was  only  one  authentic  vision  for Germany-in-Europe,  and  (ii)  maintaining the  latter.
239  NATO’s ‘Harmel report’ and the Ambiguity of Detente The  differences  emerging  between  German  and  American  ideas  of  ordering  Europe  (transformation  versus  status  quo)  were  managed  until  1969  by  Kiesinger  moderating  Brandt’s views and Johnson embodying the image of Kennedy-America.
Bonn  was  eager  to  legitimize  its  move  towards  Ostpolitik  through  NATO,  and  in  a  speech  to  the  WEU  assembly  in  January  1967,  Brandt  described  NATO  as  “a  living  organism  which  adapts  to  changing  demands  (Anforderungen)”  (in  Brandt,  1970:  16).
Upon the initiative of Belgian foreign minister Pierre Harmel a working group  was put in place with the task to come up with a document which would ensure NATO’s  viability  as  a  forum  for  pursuing  a  common  project.
The  resulting  document  from  December  1967  was  entitled  “The  Future  Tasks  of the  Alliance”  and  informally  called  the Harmel Report.m  From  Bonn’s  perspective  the  Report  was  important  in  manifesting  that  “the  ultimate  political  purpose  of  the  Alliance  is  to  achieve  a  just  and  lasting  peaceful  order  in  Europe” and that to this end “the possibility of a crisis cannot be excluded as long as the  central  political  issues  in  Europe,  first  and  foremost  the  German  question,  remain  unsolved.”  It then  combines  two views on  how this  “uncertainty”  should  be  dealt with,  namely  (i)  through  the  maintenance  of  “a  suitable  military  capability  to  assure  the  balance of forces” to create “a climate of stability” in which (ii) the Alliance can “pursue  the  search  for  progress  towards  a  more  stable  relationship  in  which  the  underlying  political  issues  can  be  solved”.
As  such,  the  report  states  that  “military  security  and  a  policy  of  detente  are  not  contradictory  but  complementary”.
Any  such  settlement  must  end  the  unnatural  barriers  between  Eastern  and  Western  Europe,  which  are  most  clearly  and  cruelly  manifested in the division of Germany”  It  goes  on  stating  that,  consequently,  the  Allies  would  examine  “suitable  policies  designed  to  achieve  a  just  and  stable  order  in  Europe,  to  overcome  the  division  of  Germany  and  to  foster  European  security”.
Here  the  report  also  describes  NATO  as  “an  effective  forum  and  clearing  house  for  the  exchange  of  information and views” and  recognises that “to this end the practice of frank and timely  consultations  needs  to  be  deepened  and  improved”,  in  particular  when  discussing  “the  problem of German reunification and its relationship to a European settlement”.
For Bonn the value of  the  Harmel  Report was  its commitment to overcoming German division/the  ‘unnatural’  374  One  scholar tracing the  development of the  idea of ‘detente’  in  US  administrations  from  the  1950s  onwards  notes  it  was  “among  the  most  contentious  terms  in  diplomatic  discourse”  (Froman,  1991:  1).
In the  words  of one  US  official  the  report was  “to  fill  in  a  mental  picture  of the Atlantic system  we  wish  to  build”,  which  basically  meant to  solidify the  cohesion of the  Western  space and to complement a  ‘peace through strength’  with talks  with Moscow about arms control (Thomas  1997:  89f., emphasis added), displayed in the  Harmel Reports’ emphasis on stability/stable relationships rather than change.
In  June  1968  his  policy  planning  staff produced  an  important  paper  entitled  “Conception  of European  Security”  which  laid  out  three  visions  of a  European  peace  order  achieved  through  (i)  significant  reduction  of  tensions  between  the  two  pacts  through  through  gradual  institutionalisation  of a  common  security  conference,  and  (iii)  replacing the  two  pacts  through a European security system supported by both superpowers without having them  as  members.376  The  paper  noted  that  the  first  option  was  the  most  likely  and  would  at  least keep the German question  open  and the  second would  be  desirable for Germany’s  neighbours  but  would  offer  little  perspective  for  overcoming  the  division.
376 Tellingly, the three security  systems  were discussed  in purely political terms,  with  the report  noting that it had “abstained from the presentation of military aspects” (in Hacke, 2003:  155).
),  and  his third version resonated with the idea of a European Security Conference proposed by  the  Warsaw Pact.
A  1954  proposal  from  Moscow attempting to reduce US  control  over  the  FRG  and  prevent  the  latter’s  entry  into  NATO  had  been  taken  up  by  the  Polish  foreign minister Adam Rapacki in October  1957 and modified into a proposal to create a  nuclear-free  zone  in  Central  Europe.
Repeated  by  diplomats  and  scholars  calling  for  some sort of pan-European security  system, by  1966 the  idea of a European  conference  had  become “a recurring theme”  in  statements coming from the Warsaw  Pact (Maresca  1984:  5).
By  noting  that  “the North  Atlantic  Treaty  Area cannot  be  treated  isolated  from  the  rest  of the  world”,  that  “crises  and  conflicts  arising  outside  the  area  may  impair  its  security”  the  report  indirectly  sanctioned  US  military  engagement  in  Vietnam.
Moreover,  in  the  view  of  Secretary  of  State  Dean  Rusk  it  encouraged  members  to  cooperate  over  security  issues  outside  the  treaty  area without requiring them “to go at the speed of the slowest ship” (in  Sherwood  1990:  133f.).
The engagement was to secure  South  Vietnamese independence and to demonstrate US determination to oppose the expansion  of communist order, there or ‘elsewhere’  (Gaddis, 2005 (1982): 264).
This  deepening,  that  is,  the  Nixon  administration’s  conception  of America-in-the-world  and  the  place  of Germany/Europe  took  in  it,  was  significantly  shaped  by  National  Security  Advisor,  and  after  September  1973  Secretary of State,  Henry Kissinger.377  for  reorientation,  or  what  Kissinger   in  dire  need   In particular when  it came to grand strategy and the US approach to ‘detente’  in Europe,  Kissinger was the  leading thinker and  practitioner.
According  to  the  model,  relations  among  these  entities  were  facilitated  by  a  common  interest  for  ‘security’  and  pledge  to  non­ intervention.
Ideology  was  to  play  a  reduced  role  in  judging  others,  there  was  no  ‘communist block’, and no need to change the internal order of others; that is, there was  to  be  no transformative  agenda.
As  Gaddis  notes,  while  according  to  Kissinger relations were to be “purged of (their) sentimental and emotional components”  and instead build upon “those common interests” of survival and security” he also added  “a congenial  international  environment” to the  list (Gaddis, 2005:  277).
Second, while Kissinger did  not want to create an  ‘organic’  bond to ‘Europe’, he wanted  it to  stay  close  to  the  US.
In  1966  Kissinger expressed  his  discomfort with  the  idea  of  forming some sort of Atlantic community and  noted that  his “instinct” was that Europe  and the US would work together for “common interests” without being “organically tied  together”  (in  Winand  1996:  363).
It  reacted  positively  to  a  proposal  by  Britain’s  Minister  of Defense,  Denis Healy, from  March  1969 for creating a  ‘European’  group within NATO.
But  their  problem  is  to  control  a  process  which...may  shake  Germany’s  domestic  381  How  Kissinger  felt  about the  country  of his  birth  and  how  his  personal  experiences  of the  Third  Reich  impacted  his  thinking  about  Germany-in-Europe  is  an  important  question.
249  stability  and  unhinge  its  international  position”  (Ibid.,  408f.).
trying   lobby   The  Chancellor  worked  hard  to  counter  this  impression  and  dispel  American  doubts  about his government’s commitment to the Western  project,  repeatedly assuring that his  Ostpolitik  was  a  German  contribution  to  detente.385  On  every  possible  occasion  he  emphasized to American audiences the importance of the FRG’s partnership with the US  383 Symbolic was the meeting in December  1971  where Nixon assured Brandt that despite the US  focus  on  the  Soviet  Union  and  China  “Europe  is  the  most  important,  and  the  key  to  Europe  is  Germany  (...)  The  future  of  Germany  and  its  position  in  the  Alliance  always  stands  in  the  foreground  of  American  considerations.
Yet  he  also  noted  that  overcoming  the  frozen  European  fronts  and  working  towards  peaceful  coexistence  in  Europe would  require  leaving behind  outdated theories  and  making an effort towards “a new synthesis of reality and  ideals” (ibid.,  385).
To him “the role of the United States in the  world...had  undergone  substantial  [wesentlich]  change  since  the  time  of  Kennedy”  (Brandt  1976:  379),  with  ‘wesentlich’  describing  a  change  that  cannot  be  captured  in  measurable  quantities  but  points  to  a  change  in  a  state  of authentic  being.
Tensions Towards Helsinki Recognising that NATO was not the institutional frame through which  ‘Germany’ could  unfold  into  a  Greater  European  Peace  Order,  the  proposal  for  a  European  Security  Conference  (ESC)  gained  momentum  in  Bonn.
After some back and forth establishing the conditions under  which the  conference  would  take  place,  concerning  in  particular the  demand  by  Brandt  that the  status  of Berlin  and  the  relationship  between  FRG  and  GDR had to be clarified  prior  to  the  conference,  talks  on  what  now  was  called  a  Conference  on  Security  and  253  Cooperation  in  Europe  (CSCE)  were  opened  in  Helsinki  in  July  1973.387  This  was  followed  by  working  level  negotiations  in  Geneva  from  September  1973  to  July  1975  and concluded with a meeting of heads of states in Helsinki on  1  August  1975.
those  Adenauer  had  used   For Brandt the idea of a pan-European security conference was not a  ‘Soviet’  idea.
Even  though the first concrete proposal had come from Moscow, the idea of such a conference  and  the  notion  of  ‘collective  security’  it  promised  had  circulated  among  Social  Democrats  since the  1950s.
Given  Moscow’s eagerness to engage the conference,  it also enabled the Brandt government to  practice  ‘linkage’  politics  similar  to  towards  NATO  membership.389  As  noted  earlier,  Brandt  had  accepted  that  negotiations  about  change  required the quasi-recognition of the GDR, but the aim was to tie the latter to the former.
The  ‘Eastern treaties’  and the Helsinki Final Act were interwoven, part of a two-step strategy.390 When Brandt  noted  in  March  1973  that the time had  come where the  bilateral  elements of Ostpolitik  were  to  be  replaced  by  multilateral  ones  (in  Roloff  1995:  83),  he  saw  CSCE  as  the  necessary forum  through which the  development of a Greater European  order could  be  387  In  May  1970  a  NATO  communique  laid  out  (Bonn’s)  precondition  that  the  bilateral  negotiations  between  the  FRG  and  the  Soviet  Union,  Poland  and  the  GDR  would  have  to  be  completed  beforehand.
In April  he  emphasized  in  a memo to Nixon  the need  for “consultations within  NATO  designed  to  develop  coherent  western  positions”  (Kissinger  1979:  415)  and  proposed a  ‘Committee on the Challenges of Modem  Society’  within NATO,  as well as  suggestions for a more frequent mid-level meetings.
Yet Kissinger had failed to accommodate that  Brandt  was  not  asking  for  working-level  meetings  and  talks  about  environmental  protection  and  improving  transportation  but  was  looking  for  top-level  exchanges  working towards the peaceful transforming of Greater Europe.
First, his note that the US  had  global  interests  and  responsibilities  whereas  Europeans  had  regional  ones  and  his  suggestion  to  include  Japan  in  the  common  project,  point  to  the  difference  between  American  and  European  spatial  horizons  in  their  world  building  ambitions.
Notable  in  this  response  is  that  it  maintains  that  this  development  is  anchored  in  Jefferson’s  ‘pursuit  of  happiness’  principle,  while  at  the  same  time  calling  it  an  257  ‘emancipated  partnership’  built  on  a “new  self-awareness  of Europe”  and  a “consensus  of  opinion  within  the  European  Community...formed  around  the  nucleus  of  Franco-  German solidarity” (Brandt  1973:  194f.).
While  it  was  argued  that  Brandt’s  transformative vision  of Germany-in-Greater-Europe  was  developed  in  interaction  with  ‘Kennedy  America’,  his  relationship  with  the  Nixon/Kissinger  administration,  in  particular, was not marked by creativity but by dissonance over the meaning o f ‘peace in  Europe’.
This  chapter  addresses  the  divergence  in  German-American  security  cooperation  in  the  decade  surrounding  the  end  of the  Cold  War,  specifically  Bonn’s  investment  in  CFSP  as  an  alternative to NATO  and  CSCE.
Schmidt  is  often  described  as  a  manager who,  after having completed  the  CSCE  talks  in  Helsinki,  pursued  a  strategy  of  “consolidation”  of  Ostpolitik  (Hanrieder  1989:  209f.)
While  developing  strong  bonds  with  France  and  considering  the  EC  a  valuable  institution for deepening the Western European integration,  Schmidt regarded friendship  with the US  a “clear priority” (in Banchoff 1999:  111).
Thus, although Foreign Minister  Hans-Dietrich  Genscher  worked  hard  to  keep  the  CSCE  process  alive  (see  below),  Schmidt moved the government’s emphasis back to NATO.
In  the  abovementioned  report  he  noted  that  “we  must  unify  Europe  to  also  complete  the  unification  of  Germany”  and  that  the  lessons  from  the  mishandling  of  Germany’s position at “the heart of Europe” was that “we have to and want to shape our  future  within  a  European  framework  and  resolve  our  national  question  as  a  work  of  peace”  (Kohl  1984:  3).395  For Kohl,  the  creation  of a  united  Europe  was  in  Germany’s  “existential  interest” (Bering  1999:  159; Banchoff 1999; Duffield  1998).
After fighting tuberculosis,  in  1965  Genscher became a member of the Bundestag,  serving  in  several  party offices,  including chairman of the FDP (Genscher  1995:  55-68).
Raised as a Protestant and skeptical  about using Christian beliefs as the maxim  for  guiding  politics,  the  notion  of  a  ‘Vatican  Europe’  did  not  resonate  with  him  (Genscher  1995 :  55).397  Moreover,  his  roots  in  East  Germany  bestowed  him  with  a  horizon  of experience  reaching  deeper  into  the  East than  Kohl  and,  thus,  an  emotional  attachment to the  space  beyond the wall.398 A  critique  of Adenauer’s  course,  already  in  1966  he  advocated  a “clear concept for the  future  development  in  Europe”  which  “has  nothing to do with a policy of strength” (Genscher  1995:  93).
Secretary of Defense Weinberger informed his European  counterparts that  “if detente  is  progress,  then  let  me  say that we  cannot  afford  much  more  progress”  (in  Lundestad  1990: 49).
It  was  difficult  to  see  the  strategic  rationale behind  Reagan’s policy of strength, that  is,  his denouncement of ‘detente’  and  the  focus  on  military  buildup,  including  the  controversial  Strategic  Defense  Initiative  (SDI),  in  dealing  with  the  Soviet  Union  (Posen  and  van  Evera  1983:  75ff).
And  the  dispute over the  pipeline  project  into the  Soviet Union  in the  early  1980s  and  tacit  European  attempts  to  address  security  issues  in  an  institutional  setting  outside  NATO  (see  below)  cast  doubt  that  a  stronger  Europe  was  a  ‘natural  partner’  and  fed  concerns  that  Europeans  might  ‘gang  up’  against  the  US  (Lundestad  1998:  111).
As  one  not-  so-neutral observer put it, Reagan officials considered the German Foreign Minister as a  “royal  pain  in  the  neck”  because  he  seemed  “incapable  of uttering  a  sentence  without  words  ‘European  security  conference’,  or  ‘detente’  tumbling  uncontrollably  form  his  tongue”  (Bering  1999:  21).
Institutional Choices: Dealing with Dissonance The  basis  on  which  Bonn  evaluated  security  institutions  was  captured  by  Genscher  in  1986 when he noted that Germany was  looking for an  institution providing the frame of  action  [.Handlungsrahmen]  which  allowed  it  to  pursue  its  “legitimate  wish  for  a  condition  of  peace  in  Europe  within  which  in  can  regain  its  unity  in  free  self  404  At  the  core  was  an  attempt  by  some  historians  to  rehabilitate  the  Kaiserreich  as  a  positive  memoiy space, while at the same time toning down the uniqueness of the Holocaust, not only its  importance within  the  German  biography  (as  the  sole  focus)  but  also  as  an  event  in  general  by  comparing it with Stalin’s Gulag (Kattago 2001; Verheyen  1999).
The  security  institutions  available  were  NATO  and  CSCE.
While  Kohl’s  ‘normalization’  agenda  the  Western/European  project,  it  was  visible  in  Bonn’s  exploration  of  the  EC  as  an  alternative security institution.
Notable  developments  were  occurring  in  the  EC  and  the  WEU.
While  the  1980s  are  generally  known  for  reviving  economic  integration,  culminating  in  the  1987  Single  European Act (SEA),407 attempts were made to also move the EC  into the security realm.
Genscher’s  initiative  from  November  1981  to  extend  the  EC’s  competence  in  ‘external’  relations,  strengthening  EPC  and  incorporating  ‘security’  issues  into  the  EC’s  domain  found  its  way  into a  ‘Solemn Declaration’  in  Stuttgart in  1983  (Genscher  1995:  362-366).
It was  picked  up  again  by  France  in  1984  with  a  proposal  to  revive  the  WEU,  leading to  the  Rome  declaration  from  October  1984  in  which  EC  foreign  and  defense  ministers  promised “to increase cooperation between member states in the field of security policy”  (WEU  1984).
In  October  1987,  the  WEU  Ministerial  Council  adopted  a  Platform  on  European Security Interests which declared that “we are convinced that the construction  of an  integrated  Europe  will  remain  incomplete  as  long  as  it  does  not  include  security  and defence” (WEU  1987).
273  ‘order  of Yalta’  affected  the  configuration  of the  Western  space  and,  hence,  required  adjustment  of the  Western  project.
As  one  astute  observer  pointed  out,  “the  existence  and meaning of Europe dominated  international politics in  1989” and  ‘defining Europe’  once  again  became  “a  practical  problem”  (Hoagland  1989:  34).
Whereas  Bush  reluctantly accepted the development of the EC  into a potential  economic competitor,415  he did not want this to spill over into the security realm.
274  aim of keeping the US  ‘in’  Europe was “our central vision and key organizing principle”  and the driving force behind a new European strategy group (Hutchings  1997:  157).
An NSC  memorandum from  March  1989  held  that  “the  top  priority  for  American  foreign  policy  in  Europe  should  be  the  fate  of the  Federal  Republic  of Germany...we  cannot  have  a  vision  for  Europe’s  future  that  does  not  include  an  approach  to the  ‘German question’”  (in  Zelikow and  Rice  1995:  26-28).
-  Washington accepted both and worked  on  rallying  Britain  and  France  behind  the  plan.
418 According to Kohl, he  informed Bush  about the plan a few hours before everyone else  (Kohl  1996:  167-176).
In  formulating  this  vision  Bush  could  not  quite  resist  “the  Wilsonian  temptation”  (Hutchings  1997:  149)  of making  the  world  safe  for  democracy  and  echoed  familiar  traits  of American  liberal  internationalism,  supplemented with  the  promise  for reviving  the  United  Nations  as  a  forum  for  debating  and  enforcing  order.419  A  month  later  in  Prague,  he  wove  together the  task  of fulfilling  “the  promise  of a  Europe...that  is  truly  whole  and  free”  and  a  ‘Europe’  that  would  accept new  responsibilities  and  “work with  us  in  common  cause  toward  a  new  commonwealth  of freedom...,  a  moral  community  united  in  its dedication to free  ideals...(t)hat is why our response to the challenge  in the  Persian Gulf is critical” (in Hutchings  1997:  147f.).
277  While  the  Bush  administration  expected  Germany,  the  creative  partner  in  the  Western  space, to be part of this response, the Kohl  government decided to  lay  low.420 Although  it condemned  Iraq’s actions as a breach of international  law and  supported the set-up of  sanctions,  it  did  not  want  to  share  political  responsibilities  for  military  engagement.
The government argued  that articles 87a and 26 of the Basic Law restricted the German security space to ‘NATO  territory’  and  that  Bundeswehr  engagement  in  ‘out-of-area’  operations  were  hence  illegitimate,  a  position  which  was  echoed  across  party  lines.421  O f  course,  the  constitutional  constrains  were  not  as  decisive  as  the  government put  it;422  Kohl  simply  was guided by the understanding that offensive military action was not part of normality,  more precisely, where war was not seen as an acceptable continuation of politics but the  breakdown  thereof.
As  Defense  Minister  Volker  Ruehe  (CDU)  phrased  it,  the  Gulf War had cast “a bright light on the need to redefine united Germany’s international  role”  (in  Duffield  1998:  181).
According   in   to  Karl  Lamers,   influential   It was not so much that the US  had extended the spatial horizons of the Western project  -  after  all  it  had  done  so  many times  before with  engagements  in  Korea and Vietnam,  and  with  trying  to  include  Japan  in  the  Western  world.
The  key  problem  was  that  becoming  a  creative  agent  in  the  New  World  Order  required  adapting  the  German  ‘Civilian power’  narrative embedded  in the vision of unfolding  into a Greater European  Peace  Order.
Karl  Lamers  reminded  in  an  internal  paper  that  “responsibility  is  contingent upon  power”  and  warned  that  German  denial  about  its  power  could  lead  its  Western  partners to think the country was back on a Sonderweg:  “If Germany acts as  if  it  has  no  power,  it  will  awaken  only  mistrust  among  its  neighbors.
Thus  they  were  followed  by  promises  for  “new  developments”  (Ibid.).
Yet  such  ‘developments’ de facto required a reinterpretation of the desirable order ‘Germany’ was  unfolding  into,  that  is,  the  project  unified  Germany  was  responsible  for (Baumann  and  Hellmann 2001).
that  Germany  was  open   Signs of Institutional Rivalry Scholars  like to  argue that  Bonn  and  Washington  agreed  to  embed  a unified  Germany-  in-Europe  in NATO,  CSCE,  and  EC/WEU,  satisfying the  various  parties  involved,  and  that  these  were  ‘interlocking’  institutions  complementing  each  other  (Anderson  and  280  Goodman  1993:  39ff).425  The  theoretical  lens  applied  here  suggests,  instead,  that  Bonn  invested  in  those  three  institutional  frames  to  assess  through  which  it  could  offset  the  dissonance  with  the  US  exposed  by the  Gulf War,  that  is,  which  was  most suitable  for  negotiating its national biography without losing its sense of authenticity.426  For reasons noted earlier, the Bush administration made it clear to Kohl that it expected  unified  Germany  to  remain  in  NATO,  a  requirement  shared  by  France  and  Britain  in  their  reluctant  agreement to  unification  (Zelikow  and  Rice  1995:  13If,  141,  154).
The  US National  Security  Strategy from  March  1990  stressed that NATO was to remain the  primary security  institution  in  Europe which  “sustains the  overall  structure  of stability”  (in  Theiler 2003:  185).
With that  assurance,  Kohl  signed  up  to  NATO’s  London  declaration  from  July  1990  which  proclaimed  NATO  as  the  primary  security  institution  in  Europe  and  agreed  to  its  function as “the principle venue for consultations” in May  1991  (Hutchings  1997: 279).
The  strategic  concept  agreed  upon  in  Rome  in  November  1991  suggested  that  the  scope  of NATO  missions  was  not  limited  to  Europe  by  noting  that  “Alliance  security must take account of the global  context” (NATO  1991,  §  12) and that members  “could...be called upon to contribute to global stability” (Ibid,  §  41).
426 Although  outside the  scope  of this  analysis,  Germany’s  attempt to participate  in  formulating  Bush’s  ‘New  World  Order’  included  investment  in  the  United  Nations  (UN).
The  Kohl  government  advocated  the  importance  of  international  law,  supported  UN  ‘peacekeeping’  missions  and bid  for a permanent  seat  in  the  Security  Council  (Ruehe,  1992a;  Thraenert,  1993;  Kuehne  1996; Daalgard Nielsen 2006).
281  the  continued  primacy of conventional  and  nuclear  capabilities  and  cleared  the  ground  for the  1992  Oslo  agreement which  expanded  NATO’s  strategic  scope  by  adopting the  possibility  of  ‘out  of  area’  missions  authorized  by  the  UN  Security  Council.
An  initiative  by  Kohl  and  Mitterand from December  1990 called for a strengthening of the Community’s political  and  security  realm,  followed  by a number of further Franco-German  initiatives pushing  for the integration of the WEU into the EU and suggesting to expand the German-Franco  brigade into a multinational corps answerable to the EU (‘the Eurocorps’) (Meiers 2006:  125-138).
This  set  the  agenda  for  negotiations  among  EC  members  leading  to  the  integration of the EPC  into the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) and to the creation  of  a  pillar  of  ‘Common  Foreign  and  Security  Policy’  (CFSP)  within  the  EU’s  new  institutional  framework.
By pushing for the prospect of having defence  issues discussed  in the EU, the Treaty broke with the understanding that ‘defence’  was a term exclusively  reserved for NATO (Hill and Smith 2000:  152).428  That these developments in the EC did  not quite fit Bush’s  ‘Atlantic frame’  and  laid the  groundwork  for  a  potential  alternative  to  NATO  was  recognized  in  Washington.
Behind  close  doors,  he  bluntly  asked  “if Western  Europe  intends  to  create  a  security  organization  outside  the  Alliance,  tell  me  now!’’(Hutchings  1997:  277-281).
428 "The common  foreign and security policy shall  include all  questions related to the security of  the Union, including the eventual framing of a common defense policy" (Article J.4,  1, TEU).
283  the  primary  security  institution.
To this end, the German  government  successfully  lobbied  for  the  ominous  European  Security  and  Defense  Identity (ESDI) within NATO  and  came to echo the  British  view that  WEU  served  as a  ‘bridge’  within NATO  (Tams  1999;  Kirchner 2000;  Theiler 2003:  184ff;  Hilz 2005).
Exposing Dissonance II: Bosnia (1992-95) Tensions  among  groups  in  the  Former  Republic  of Yugoslavia  (FRY)  had  been  rising  since  1991  and  in  Bosnia  war  broke  out  in  April  1992.
Once  in the  White  House,  he  formulated  such  a  broad  (and  familiar)  role,  namely  of America  as  a  global  force  for  the  good  life,  promoting  the  pacifying  power  of  liberal  values  and  the  humanitarian  purpose  of  UN  peacekeeping  missions.435  National  Security  Advisor  Anthony  Lake  described  the  strategic  outlook  of the  Clinton  administration  as  one  of  ‘pragmatic  neo-Wilsonianism’  and  ‘helping  the  helpless’,  criticized  by  others  as  an  attempt to  “turn  American  foreign  policy  into  a  branch  of social  work”  (Mandelbaum  1996:  18;  Hyland  1999:  58).
Visiting Europe for the first time in January  1994,  almost a year  after his  inauguration,  Clinton  worked  hard  to  reassure  his  counterparts  of US  support  for  European  integration  (Clinton  1994;  Eizenstat  1994).
Yet  while  his  positive  assessment of the EU as an economic partner carrying a liberal world order and his call  for a new transatlantic security partnership “improved the atmosphere”,  his visit did not  address  deeper  issues  (Smith  and  Woolcock  1994:  473f.
437  The  1994  Whitebook  of the  Ministry  of  Defense  warned  that  “the  development  towards  peaceful coexistence in the whole of Europe is not irreversible” (Weissbuch  1994: 23, 27, 30).
In  a  speech  to  the  Bundestag  in  January  1994,  Kohl  argued  that  the  conflict demonstrated that the development of a European  Peace Order and the political  unity  of  Europe  were  “more  important  than  ever”.
And  “if Europe  were  to  drift  apart”  the  paper  warned  it  would  be  “difficult  for  Germany  to  give  a  clear  orientation  to  its  internal order” (Lamers  1994:  105).
The  Kohl  government put significant  effort  into  mobilizing  EC/EU  diplomacy  and  devising  “a  new  form  of  crisis  management”  through  a  strengthened  CSCE  (Genscher  1995:  320ff;  759f.).
In  light  of these  developments,  the  Kohl  government had  to  push  for  a  change  of the  German  narrative.
To be  able to support any kind of military engagement ‘out of area’  an adjustment of this space  was required.
including  peacemaking”,   in  crisis  management,   In  March  1993  the  government introduced  a bill to clarify the  ‘casus  foederis’,  arguing  that military missions  ‘abroad’  were to be allowed  under a UN  mandate without change  of the  constitution  (Gutjahr  1994:  217).
Referring to Article 24  of the Basic Law which  states that “With  a view to maintaining peace, the Federation may enter into a system of mutual collective  security”,  the  Court argued that  participation  in  ‘out  of area’  missions  was  in  harmony  with  the  Basic  Law  as  long  as  these  missiond  took  place  within  the  framework  of  ‘systems  of  collective  security’  “strictly  bound  to  the  preservation  of  peace”  and  approved  by  a  simple  majority  of the  Bundestag.
While the Court was criticized for defining alliances such as NATO and WEU as systems of  collective  security,  which  for  critics  was  reserved  for  UN  and  CSCE,  the  Court’s  view  corresponds to the treatment of these organisations in this thesis.
However the debate can be seen  as  reflecting  domestic  differences  about  which  institution  was  most  appropriate  for  embedding  Germany’s  ontological  security.
For  a  detailed  legal-political  analysis o f ‘systems of collective security’, see Jaberg (1996).
289  assured that “normalcy in  foreign and security policy does not mean to act as the worlds  policeman,  it does not mean to send German soldiers to all the burning spots worldwide”  (Kinkel  1994b).
The  1994 Whitebook of the Ministry of Defense stated the primary goal  of security  policy  to  be  “the  political  formation  [Gestaltmg]  of peace  in  the  near  and  expanded  periphery  of  Germany”  (Weissbuch  1994:  43;  Ruehe,  1995),  and  Kohl  declared that the Bundeswehr would  not get involved  in territories which  had  once been  occupied by the  Wehrmacht.
The  adaptation  of  Germany’s  national  biography  was  practically  manifested  in  the  support of NATO’s air-campaign  in Bosnia in June  1995  with non-combat forces439 and  occured  on the back of a tense  and well-documented domestic debate.440 The  coherence  of the  narrative  was  maintained  by  arguing  that  the  German  memory  space  generated  two  lessons, namely the moral maxim ‘never again genocide’  and  ‘never again war’, and  that  if the  two  were  in  conflict the  former trumped the  latter.
As  Kinkel  argued,  the  ‘culture of restraint’ was not acceptable to Western friends who had liberated  ‘Germany’  in  1945  and  who now  expected  Germans to “actively contribute towards the  protection  of  the  international  order...especially  in  Europe”  (Kinkel  1994a).
290  government  embedded  the  redefinition  of  German  ‘responsibility’  in  foreign  and  security policy in the project of European integration (Kreile  1996).
Suddenly  the  Balkans  became a symbol  for “Europe’s  freedom  and  Europe’s  stability”  and  “vital  to  our  own  national  security”  (Clinton  1995  in  Hansen  1995g).
In  a  Newsweek  article  entitled  Why Bosnia  Matters  To  America,  Clinton justified US engagement as necessary not only to end human suffering and build  a  peaceful  Europe,  but  also  to  maintain  NATO’s  status  as  the  dominant  institution  for  ordering  Europe:  “If the  US  does  not  do  its  part  in  a NATO  mission...we  would  also  weaken  NATO  -  the  anchor  of America’s  and  Europe’s  security -   and jeopardize  US  leadership in Europe” (Clinton  1995b).
Instead, it continued to press for a strategy of  ‘lift  (the  sanctions)  and  strike  (from  the  air)’,  a  practice  opposed  by  European  NATO  allies  who  wanted  to  uphold  sanctions  and  strengthen  the  UN  troops  stationed  on  the  ground  (Owen  1995;  Hansen  2006).
US  passivity  had  prevented the  institution  from  taking  a  more  active  role  early  on  and  the  sidelining  of  Allies  during  the  operation,  stretching  into  the  post-conflict  stage,  had  exposed the  limits of US  willingness to work together.
In  crude terms, the  relationship with  the  US  within  NATO  had  become a generator rather  than a controlling mechanism of German anxiety.443  Emancipation: Investment in CFSP/France As  for  the  alternatives,  the  high  hopes  for  CSCE  as  a  forum  for  building  a  Greater  European  Peace  Order  had  not  been  fulfilled.
Formally  Bonn  continued  to  support  CSCE,  most notably by turning it into an actual organisation (OSCE), yet US disinterest  in  the  institution  and  its  apparent  ineffectiveness  in  ‘managing’  the  Bosnian  conflict  diminished  its value considerably for negotiating German authentic becoming.
442  The  US  oversaw  NATO’s  Implementation  Force  to  which  Bonn  contributed  4,000  troops  (Schake  1998).
The  1994 coalition treaty and the subsequent  Bundestag  address  of  the  re-elected  Kohl  government  voiced  support  for  the  development  of  an  independent  European  security  and  defence  identity  (Bundestag  1994c).
Four  of the  five  central  security  objectives  listed  in  the  Whitebook  explicitly  linked German  security to European  integration, with only one  stressing the  importance  of  the  transatlantic  alliance  “because  the  global  power  of  the  United  States  is  indispensable  for  international  stability”  before  in  a  separate  point  calling  for  the  creation  of a “new security  order encompassing all  European  states”  (Whitebook  1994:  42).
The  paper  even  went  so  far  as  suggesting  that  “the  USA  can  no  longer play  its traditional role” and that Germany’s relations with France were now “the  yardstick by which to measure its sense of belonging to the West’s community of shared  political  and  cultural  values”  (Ibid.,  112).
Kohl did not stop calling NATO the  “security anchor” and  “bedrock”  of Europe’s security architecture  (Duffield  1998:  118)  444  See  Weissmann  (1994);  Gillessen  (1994);  Diner  (1994);  Baring  (1994).
6)  and  the  earlier  mentioned  idea  of a  European Security and Defence Identity within NATO,  supported  by Clinton during his  1994 visit and confirmed at the  1996 Berlin summit.
And so it was  in  an  attempt  to  improve  the  latter  that  Bonn  continued  to  cooperate  with  France  to  enhance  WEU  capabilities  and  integrate  them  into  the  EU,  as  in  a  French-German  ‘Common  Security  and  Defense  Concept’  from  December  1996  and  during  the  following  Intergovernmental Conference  in Amsterdam  (Jopp  and  Schmuck  1996;  Hilz  2005:  163-179; Meiers 2006:  1138-156).
Hence,  the  chapter suggested that the  Kohl  government pursued  a strategy of  emancipation  by  turning  to  France  as  that  friend  with  whom  it  could  invest  in  (W)EU/CFSP  as  an  alternative  forum  for  negotiating  a  project  which  required  less  compromise to the authenticity of the German narrative.
295  296  CHAPTER ELEVEN: CONCLUSION  This thesis has attempted to assess, conceptually and empirically, the motives behind the  emergence  and  the  decline  of  interstate  security  cooperation,  defined  as  the  costly  investment  in  a  common  international  institution  and  applied  to  German-American  relations  between  1945  and  1995.
It  took  as  its  starting  point  Germany’s  subsequent  investment in three different security  institutions  for the  purpose  of ‘European  security’  which  over  time  came  to  exclude  the  United  States,  namely  (what  became)  NATO,  CSCE  and  CFSP.
This  investment was  framed  as  a  phenomenon  of German-American  security  cooperation  moving  from  ‘consensus’  (1945-55)  via  ‘tension’  (1965-75)  to  ‘divergence’  (1985-95).
Against  this  backdrop,  the  thesis  attempted  to  build  a  new  theoretical  argument  for  explaining  interstate  security cooperation  and  apply  it to the  historical  case of German-  American  cooperation.
Below  I  briefly  summarize the  argument and  highlight some of  the  contributions  to  IR theory  and  to  our  understanding  of German-American  security  cooperation.
Argument in  this  thesis  was  that  states  invest  in  common  The  basic  argument  advanced  international  institutions to pursue  a shared project of ‘world building’.
More precisely,  it  was  suggested  that  (1)  states  are  driven  by  the  aim  to  control  anxiety  through  the  formulation of a meaningful narrative of (coming into)  ‘being-in-the-world’  and that (2)  the formulation and  practical  maintenance of such  an authentic biographical  narrative  is  pursued  with  states  regarded  as  friends.
It  was  further  argued  that  (3)  enduring  dissonance  between  friends  about  visions  of order  signifies  a  process  of estrangement  which  brings  ambiguity  in  the  biographical  narrative  and  undermines  the  friendship’s  ability  to  control  anxiety.
It was  argued  that the  German-American consensus of NATO  as  the  security  institution  for ordering  ‘Europe’  rested  on  the  agreement  of  a  shared  project  of  ‘world  building’  in  which  respective  national  biographies  -   narratives  of  authentic  becoming  -   were  embedded.
It was shown  that against French opposition and buttressed by the dystopia of a communist Germany-  in-Europe,  Adenauer  and  US  administrations  under  Truman  and  Eisenhower  worked  closely together to bring the FRG into NATO.
Specifically,  the analysis of the second period (1965-1975) developed  in  chapter nine  highlighted the  dissonance  between  Brandt’s  and  Kissinger/Nixon’s  conception  of a peaceful  ‘Europe’,  with the  former pursuing a transformative  and  the  latter a  static/conservative  vision.
Contributions The  first  contribution  the  thesis  makes  is  that  it  offers  a  strategy  for  how  to  build  a  theory (of interstate  security cooperation).
It puts  forward  the  notion  of a  ‘deep theory’  as a causal  narrative starting on the  level of ontology which  anchors the meaning of the  state  and  its  ‘national  security  interest’  in  an  account  of the  human  condition  (chapter  two).
It  suggests  that  this  offers  a  new  way  to  understand  the  meaning  of a  ‘common  security  interest’  as  one  of  sustaining  a  shared  project  which  enables  authentic  becoming.
One can trace  its effects,  however, by paying  attention to the  strategies employed by the  Self to control  anxiety and, thus,  understand  the  ‘national  interest’  as the formulation  of a coherent and  authentic national  biography  (e.g., Williams 2005).
The  philosophical  grounding  of the  need  for  historical  analogies and visions as anxiety controlling mechanisms directs attention to the temporal  ordering  of this  space  by  pointing  to  the  creative  act  of transforming  memories  into  meaningful  visions  lending  direction  to  unfolding.
The  existential  reading of the  state as  a national  biography directs attention to a certain  reading  of  what  drives  the  security  policy  of  governments.
Rather  than  focusing  on  survival  understood  as  the  maintenance  of territorial  integrity,  the  thesis  supports  the  argument  that  states  strive  for  ‘ontological  security’  (e.g.,  Mitzen  2006).
That  said,  it  goes  beyond  the  Giddensian  focus  on  ‘routine  practices’  by  emphasizing the  desire  for  authenticity which,  it was  argued,  cannot  be  satisfied  by  routines  (chapter four).
In this  current,  the  argument  that  governments  are  primarily  concerned  with  formulating  a  coherent  narrative  of,  for  instance,  ‘Germany’  situated  in  space  and  time  offers  an  alternative  to  the  argument  advanced  by  Haftendom  (1984)  that  ‘unity’  and  ‘security’  were  conflicting  goals  for  German  policymakers  during  the  Cold  War.
Furthermore,  by  suggesting  that  states  seek  friends  to  control  their  anxiety,  the  thesis  shifts  the  focus  away  not only  from the  ‘collective’  but  also  from  the  ‘enemy’  as that through  which  a  sense  of Self is  stabilized.
By  offering  a  reading  of security  interdependence  between  Germany  and  the  US  as  internally  conditioned  and  sustained  through  friendship,  this  thesis  substantiates  the  notion  that  German-American  security  cooperation  is  internally  organised around shared values (e.g., Risse-Kappen  1995) and highlights the  importance  of a common spatial orientation,  in this case the overlapping commitment to a particular  order o f ‘Europe’  in ‘the West’.
In  contrast to the reading of institutions as either neutral  ‘information providers’  (utilitarian  institutionalism),  or  active  ‘socializing  agents’  (moderate  constructivism),  it  conceives  of international  institutions as sites for friends to negotiate their common world building  447 As historians recently pointed out the  ‘Europeanization’  of Germany occurred long before the  framework  of European  integration  was  established  (Fervert  2005:  11;  Blackburn  2005).
The  spatial  conception  of  ‘America’  requires  even  more  rethinking,  as  despite  the  debate  about  American  ‘empire’  the  US  is  still  read  as  a  representative  of the  classic  notion  of sovereignty  (Keohane 2002).
301  project  in  both  deliberation  (discourse)  and  activities  (practice).
This  is  not to  suggest  that all  members in  international  institutions are friends but, rather, that they are used by  friends  to  order the  experienced  space  and  invest  in  a  shared  vision  of what this  space  should  be.
Sixth,  the  friendship  lens  enhances  the  understanding  of  ‘power’  in  international  relations  (Barnett  and  Duvall  2005;  Berenskoetter  and  Williams  2007).
It  does  so  by  highlighting  two  power  phenomena  in  the  process  of  shared  world  building  which  significantly differ from the conventional  (neo)realist reading:  It was argued that central  to  friendship  is (i)  a process of mutual  empowerment lending direction  and resolve  and  to  each  others’  unfolding and  that within  this  process  friends  not only  enable  authentic  becoming  but,  inevitably,  also  (ii)  exert  reciprocal  ‘soft’  power  over  each  other  by  requiring adaptation of respective national biographies (chapter six and seven)  This  angle  shines  a  light on  the  German-American  relationship  which  is  different from  that of ‘great power competition’  and supports the scholarly agenda of viewing Germany  as  a  player  rather  than  a  playground  (Banchoff  1999;  Weber  and  Kowert  2007).
As  such,  in  design  and  purpose  CFSP  must  be  seen  less  a  late  fulfilment  of  EDC  (see  chapter  eight)  but,  rather,  as  an  institution  which  comes closer to Bahr’s  1968  ‘third version’  of a European System of Collective Security  (see chapter nine).
Looking Ahead The  expansion  of  the  ‘data  base’  provides  important  insights  for  understanding  the  opportunities and limits of contemporary US-German security cooperation, aided by that  the  analysis  resisted the  temptation  of rigidly  separating the  ‘Cold  War’  and  the  ‘post-  Cold  War’  period  (see  chapter  ten).
If these tensions and the parallel  support  of German  governments  for  a  European  Security  and  Defence  Policy  (ESDP),  established  in  1999,  are  any  indicator,  then  German  emancipation  has  not  been  halted  (Forsberg 2005).
Hence,  my  analysis  suggests  that  Atlanticist  scholars  were not entirely wrong to diagnose the “twilight of the West” (Coker  1998) and to note  that  preventing  its  “collapse”  (Harries  1993)  required  a  new,  unique  long-term  vision  carrying  the  West  and,  hence,  NATO  (Huntington  1996).
Common  interventions  in  Kosovo  (1999)  and  Afghanistan  (2001),  which  required  the  Schroeder government to further adjust Germany’s national biography, did not appear to  recreate  common ground  for resonance but,  if anything,  increased  German commitment  to ESDP (Berenskoetter and Giegerich, 2008).
This opens up the question of degrees of friendship, that  is,  of whether  some  friends  can  be  closer than  others  and  whether  multiple  friendships  may work  in complementing ways.448 In that sense, more than anything, this thesis is an  invitation  to  further  explore  the  promises  and  limitations  of friendship  in  international  politics.
448  Consider  the  analogy  of the  Self as  house  with  many  rooms  where  different  friends  have  access  “to  different  rooms  at  different times  or  venture  into  them  in  a  different  order”  (Allan,  1989:  14f.).

Workshop Summary Report  Cyber Threats and International Cooperation    February 26, 2015  Washington, DC    Rapporteurs: Amelia M. Wolf, Research Associate, Center for Preventive Action (CPA); Aliza Litchman,  Intern, CPA     This  workshop  was  cosponsored  by  the  International  Institutions  and  Global  Governance  program  (IIGG)  and  the  Digital  and  Cyberspace  Policy  program  at the  Council  on Foreign Relations  (CFR), and  was  made possible by  the  generous support of the Robina Foundation.
Hackers attacked Target in January 2014 and stole credit card information from more than  forty million customers, which they sold on the black market for $53.7 million.
An attack on JPMorgan Chase went  unnoticed for two months—despite the company’s $250 million cybersecurity budget—affecting seventy-six  million households and seven million businesses.
The increase in the frequency, scale, and  sophistication of cyberattacks has raised pressing questions about how the United States can deter adversarial state  and nonstate actors; respond to cyberattacks of varying intent; cooperate internationally to establish norms for  appropriate activity in cyberspace; and facilitate private-public partnerships to enhance deterrence, defense, and  attribution capabilities.
In light of current challenges, CFR’s International Institutions and Global Governance  program and Digital and Cyberspace Policy program cosponsored the workshop “Cyber Threats and International  Cooperation.” The meeting took place on February 26, 2015, at CFR’s office in Washington, DC, bringing  together cybersecurity experts from the government, academic, nonprofit, and private sectors.
SESSION ONE   The State of Cyber Threats   Cybercrime has changed the nature of conflict by blurring the line between state and nonstate actors.
A low cost of entry has allowed nonstate actors—including terrorist and criminal organizations, intellectual   property thieves, and even lone hackers—to conduct damaging cyberattacks that target technologically advanced  countries.
Though there are higher costs and greater capability requirements for large-scale attacks, such as with  Stuxnet, any actor that wants to conduct a limited attack does not need to develop its own offensive cyber  capability, but can simply buy malware on the black market.
They noted the widespread concern that a wrongful attribution or  disproportionate response risks escalation into a crisis, which is of particular concern for situations with already  heightened tensions or bilateral relationships that lack the necessary methods of communication to clarify  misunderstandings, such as bilateral crisis channels between corresponding national cyber agencies.
There is also a growing trend of malicious actors positioning malware on networks and software without a clear   intent.
These could be designed for espionage or to be activated for future attacks that would be particularly damaging  to industrial control systems, which support critical infrastructure.
Coordination and International Cooperation   To date, the United States has made some strides in collaborating with states and international institutions to address  the evolving threat of cyberattacks.
The United States has developed plans for bilateral cybersecurity collaboration,  most recently with Canada and the United Kingdom; hosted a White House Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer  Protection; and participated in numerous United Nations (UN) meetings.
They agreed that increased  collaboration is needed to establish norms for appropriate activities in cyberspace, develop standards for state      2   responsibility for cyberattacks launched within a state’s territory, and identify best practices for deterring and  defending against nonstate cyberattackers, as well as holding them accountable for their actions.
In order to  address these challenges, the United States is working to develop a normative framework for activity in cyberspace,  which would also allow the United States and its allies to collectively act against attackers.
To date, it has made  substantial gains by defining its preferred norms in the 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace and recognizing  that international law applies to state action in cyberspace.
Additionally, while participating in the UN Group of  Governmental Experts, the United States has proposed three specific norms for how states should act in cyberspace  during peacetime:      ?
States should not conduct or knowingly support activity intended to prevent national Computer Security Incident   Response Services (CSIRTs) from responding to cyber incidents.
States should cooperate with requests for assistance from other states in investigating cyber crimes.
Moving forward, U.S.  efforts should be enhanced by confidence-building measures, including routine cooperation to institute norms and  meet cyber challenges, and enhanced transparency, which will be vital to reducing mistrust and tensions between  rivals in cyberspace.
While norms are intrinsic to setting standards for state operations in cyberspace, their effectiveness is limited to   large groups of like-minded individuals—primarily state actors that share the same values—given that nonstate actors  do not operate according to the same rules.
Although Russia and China may be potential adversaries, encouraging  their participation in cybersecurity cooperative efforts can help shape their behavior.
SESSION  THREE   Working Lunch   Private-sector companies have expanded cyber intelligence—formerly a government-only domain—enhanced  defensive technology, and opened a new avenue of information sharing.
To better mitigate against and prevent attacks, companies will have to  adapt to an environment of persistent cyber threats, remain vigilant, and strengthen defenses.
Unfortunately, as  participants pointed out, companies often opt out of cybersecurity because of the large accompanying expenses or  lack of knowledge about the available options or about how to navigate the insurance marketplace.
As the leading target of malicious cyberattacks, the private sector will play a vital role in setting normative   standards of behavior in cyberspace and enhances U.S. defenses.
3   Consequently, like offensive cyber actors, the line between state and nonstate defensive actors has been blurred and  inherently demanded a collaborative approach by private and public sector actors.
Participants discussed why private-sector companies are disincentivized from sharing information.
First is the fear   of a breach being publicized, which could harm the public perception of the company’s security.
Second is a  company’s obligation to clients that limits the disclosure of potentially sensitive information.
However, in order to play a role in international dialogues intended to shape  standards for operating in the cyber domain, which they desire to do, private-sector companies must share  information and act collectively to present actionable ideas.
Participants identified numerous steps that public and private actors could take to enhance collaboration, such as   distinguishing cybersecurity needs based on company size rather than sector; undertaking drills to test responses  during a cyberattack, identifying which public and private actors are responsible for what and how to facilitate a quick  and collective response; and enhancing liability insurance for information sharing, building off of the National  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework.
Additionally, as participants pointed out,  cybersecurity is currently an opt-in market and needs to transform into an opt-out market to adequately strengthen  defense.
This would require congressional legislation to incentivize private-sector companies and hold them  accountable for their inaction.
Productive information sharing between the public and private sectors already occurs on an ad-hoc basis, primarily   based on personal relationships.
First, public-private information sharing  usually focuses on responding to particular types of threats, actors, and malware, but should be reoriented to focus on  tools, technologies, and vulnerabilities, which would enhance defenses.
This will entail clarifying responsibilities of the  government and private sector, differentiating between policy and legal issues, and identifying which government  agencies and public actors handle specific types of cyber threats.
CONCLUSION   Although the United States has taken steps to enhance international and public-private collaboration on  cybersecurity, much work is left to be done to enhance deterrence, strengthen defense, set standards for operating  in cyberspace, and develop appropriate response options for malicious activity.
Further delay risks opening a space for state actors with conflicting perceptions of appropriate behavior in  cyberspace to take the lead in or thwart international efforts to establish norms.
