   Workshop Summary Report  Cyber Threats and International Cooperation    February 26, 2015  Washington, DC    Rapporteurs: Amelia M. Wolf, Research Associate, Center for Preventive Action (CPA); Aliza Litchman,  Intern, CPA     This  workshop  was  cosponsored  by  the  International  Institutions  and  Global  Governance  program  (IIGG)  and  the  Digital  and  Cyberspace  Policy  program  at the  Council  on Foreign Relations  (CFR), and  was  made possible by  the  generous support of the Robina Foundation.
Hackers attacked Target in January 2014 and stole credit card information from more than  forty million customers, which they sold on the black market for $53.7 million.
An attack on JPMorgan Chase went  unnoticed for two months—despite the company’s $250 million cybersecurity budget—affecting seventy-six  million households and seven million businesses.
The increase in the frequency, scale, and  sophistication of cyberattacks has raised pressing questions about how the United States can deter adversarial state  and nonstate actors; respond to cyberattacks of varying intent; cooperate internationally to establish norms for  appropriate activity in cyberspace; and facilitate private-public partnerships to enhance deterrence, defense, and  attribution capabilities.
In light of current challenges, CFR’s International Institutions and Global Governance  program and Digital and Cyberspace Policy program cosponsored the workshop “Cyber Threats and International  Cooperation.” The meeting took place on February 26, 2015, at CFR’s office in Washington, DC, bringing  together cybersecurity experts from the government, academic, nonprofit, and private sectors.
SESSION ONE   The State of Cyber Threats   Cybercrime has changed the nature of conflict by blurring the line between state and nonstate actors.
A low cost of entry has allowed nonstate actors—including terrorist and criminal organizations, intellectual   property thieves, and even lone hackers—to conduct damaging cyberattacks that target technologically advanced  countries.
Though there are higher costs and greater capability requirements for large-scale attacks, such as with  Stuxnet, any actor that wants to conduct a limited attack does not need to develop its own offensive cyber  capability, but can simply buy malware on the black market.
They noted the widespread concern that a wrongful attribution or  disproportionate response risks escalation into a crisis, which is of particular concern for situations with already  heightened tensions or bilateral relationships that lack the necessary methods of communication to clarify  misunderstandings, such as bilateral crisis channels between corresponding national cyber agencies.
There is also a growing trend of malicious actors positioning malware on networks and software without a clear   intent.
These could be designed for espionage or to be activated for future attacks that would be particularly damaging  to industrial control systems, which support critical infrastructure.
Coordination and International Cooperation   To date, the United States has made some strides in collaborating with states and international institutions to address  the evolving threat of cyberattacks.
The United States has developed plans for bilateral cybersecurity collaboration,  most recently with Canada and the United Kingdom; hosted a White House Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer  Protection; and participated in numerous United Nations (UN) meetings.
They agreed that increased  collaboration is needed to establish norms for appropriate activities in cyberspace, develop standards for state      2   responsibility for cyberattacks launched within a state’s territory, and identify best practices for deterring and  defending against nonstate cyberattackers, as well as holding them accountable for their actions.
In order to  address these challenges, the United States is working to develop a normative framework for activity in cyberspace,  which would also allow the United States and its allies to collectively act against attackers.
To date, it has made  substantial gains by defining its preferred norms in the 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace and recognizing  that international law applies to state action in cyberspace.
Additionally, while participating in the UN Group of  Governmental Experts, the United States has proposed three specific norms for how states should act in cyberspace  during peacetime:      ?
States should not conduct or knowingly support activity intended to prevent national Computer Security Incident   Response Services (CSIRTs) from responding to cyber incidents.
States should cooperate with requests for assistance from other states in investigating cyber crimes.
Moving forward, U.S.  efforts should be enhanced by confidence-building measures, including routine cooperation to institute norms and  meet cyber challenges, and enhanced transparency, which will be vital to reducing mistrust and tensions between  rivals in cyberspace.
While norms are intrinsic to setting standards for state operations in cyberspace, their effectiveness is limited to   large groups of like-minded individuals—primarily state actors that share the same values—given that nonstate actors  do not operate according to the same rules.
Although Russia and China may be potential adversaries, encouraging  their participation in cybersecurity cooperative efforts can help shape their behavior.
SESSION  THREE   Working Lunch   Private-sector companies have expanded cyber intelligence—formerly a government-only domain—enhanced  defensive technology, and opened a new avenue of information sharing.
To better mitigate against and prevent attacks, companies will have to  adapt to an environment of persistent cyber threats, remain vigilant, and strengthen defenses.
Unfortunately, as  participants pointed out, companies often opt out of cybersecurity because of the large accompanying expenses or  lack of knowledge about the available options or about how to navigate the insurance marketplace.
As the leading target of malicious cyberattacks, the private sector will play a vital role in setting normative   standards of behavior in cyberspace and enhances U.S. defenses.
3   Consequently, like offensive cyber actors, the line between state and nonstate defensive actors has been blurred and  inherently demanded a collaborative approach by private and public sector actors.
Participants discussed why private-sector companies are disincentivized from sharing information.
First is the fear   of a breach being publicized, which could harm the public perception of the company’s security.
Second is a  company’s obligation to clients that limits the disclosure of potentially sensitive information.
However, in order to play a role in international dialogues intended to shape  standards for operating in the cyber domain, which they desire to do, private-sector companies must share  information and act collectively to present actionable ideas.
Participants identified numerous steps that public and private actors could take to enhance collaboration, such as   distinguishing cybersecurity needs based on company size rather than sector; undertaking drills to test responses  during a cyberattack, identifying which public and private actors are responsible for what and how to facilitate a quick  and collective response; and enhancing liability insurance for information sharing, building off of the National  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework.
Additionally, as participants pointed out,  cybersecurity is currently an opt-in market and needs to transform into an opt-out market to adequately strengthen  defense.
This would require congressional legislation to incentivize private-sector companies and hold them  accountable for their inaction.
Productive information sharing between the public and private sectors already occurs on an ad-hoc basis, primarily   based on personal relationships.
First, public-private information sharing  usually focuses on responding to particular types of threats, actors, and malware, but should be reoriented to focus on  tools, technologies, and vulnerabilities, which would enhance defenses.
This will entail clarifying responsibilities of the  government and private sector, differentiating between policy and legal issues, and identifying which government  agencies and public actors handle specific types of cyber threats.
CONCLUSION   Although the United States has taken steps to enhance international and public-private collaboration on  cybersecurity, much work is left to be done to enhance deterrence, strengthen defense, set standards for operating  in cyberspace, and develop appropriate response options for malicious activity.
Further delay risks opening a space for state actors with conflicting perceptions of appropriate behavior in  cyberspace to take the lead in or thwart international efforts to establish norms.

Building Cyberspace Policy  “This world—cyberspace—is a world that we depend on every single  day... [it] has made us more interconnected than at any time in human  history.”   —President Barack Obama, May 29, 2009  Digital infrastructure is increasingly the backbone of prosperous economies, vigorous research com- munities, strong militaries, transparent governments, and free societies  As never before, information  technology is fostering transnational dialogue and facilitating the global flow of goods and services   These social and trade links have become indispensable to our daily lives  Critical life-sustaining  infrastructures that deliver electricity and water, control air traffic, and support our financial system all  depend on networked information systems  Governments are now able to streamline the provision of  essential services through eGovernment initiatives  Social and political movements rely on the Internet  to enable new and more expansive forms of organization and action  The reach of networked technol- ogy is pervasive and global  For all nations, the underlying digital infrastructure is or will soon become  a national asset   To realize fully the benefits that networked technology promises the world, these systems must func- tion reliably and securely  People must have confidence that data will travel to its destination without  disruption  Assuring the free flow of information, the security and privacy of data, and the integrity of  the interconnected networks themselves are all essential to American and global economic prosperity,  security, and the promotion of universal rights   Almost a third of the world’s population uses the Internet and countless more are touched by it in their  daily lives  There are more than four billion digital wireless devices in the world today  Scarcely a half- century ago, that number was zero  We live in a rare historical moment with an opportunity to build on  cyberspace’s successes and help secure its future for U S  citizens and the global community   For these technologies to continue to empower individuals, enrich societies, and foster the research,  development, and innovation essential to building modern economies, it must retain the openness and  interoperability that have characterized its explosive growth  Underlying these are technical principles  and effective governance structures that demand our support  At the same time, our networks must be  secure and reliable; they must retain the trust of individuals, businesses and governments, and should  be resilient to arbitrary or malicious disruption   The world must collectively recognize the challenges posed by malevolent actors’ entry into cyberspace,  and update and strengthen our national and international policies accordingly  Activities undertaken  in cyberspace have consequences for our lives in physical space, and we must work towards building  the rule of law, to prevent the risks of logging on from outweighing its benefits  The future of an open,  interoperable, secure and reliable cyberspace depends on nations recognizing and safeguarding that  which should endure, while confronting those who would destabilize or undermine our increasingly  networked world   3?
InTernaTIonal  sTraTegy  for  CyBersPaCe  Strategic Approach The foundation of the United States’ international cyberspace policy is the belief that networked tech- nologies hold immense potential for our Nation, and for the world  Over the last three decades we, the  United States, have watched these technologies revolutionize our economy and transform of our daily  lives  We have also witnessed offline challenges, like exploitation and aggression, move into cyberspace   As we adapt to meet those challenges, we will lead by example  The United States will pursue an inter- national cyberspace policy that empowers the innovation that drives our economy and improves lives  here and abroad  In all this work, we are grounded in principles essential not just to American foreign  policy, but to the future of the Internet itself   Building on Successes The United States is committed to preserving and enhancing the benefits of digital networks to  our societies and economies.
These benefits have been diverse and profound  For individuals, computer networks have enhanced  productivity and prosperity; helped to overcome disadvantage and disability; brought together those  isolated by language or a rare disease; connected families and friends across distant and often-fraught  borders  For communities, they have sped first response to emergencies, expanded information-sharing  to help solve crimes, shed light on corruption, facilitated political action, and brought wide attention  to overlooked causes  For businesses, they have opened new markets and spawned billion-dollar  industries  For governments, they have enabled increased transparency, efficiency, and convenience,  and have connected leaders to those they serve  For the international community, they have provided  the foundation for a new global marketplace of ideas, and helped channel remarkable generosity in the  face of tragedy  The more freely information flows, the stronger our societies become  Properly used,  these technologies can strengthen us all, and we will work to expand their reach and improve their  operation at home and abroad    Recognizing the Challenges The United States acknowledges that the growth of these networks brings with it new challenges  for our national and economic security and that of the global community.
These challenges come in a variety of forms  Natural disasters, accidents, or sabotage can disrupt cables,  servers, and wireless networks on U S  soil and beyond  Technical challenges can be equally disruptive,  as one country’s method for blocking a website can cascade into a much larger, international network  disruption  Extortion, fraud, identity theft, and child exploitation can threaten users’ confidence in online  commerce, social networks and even their personal safety  The theft of intellectual property threatens  national competitiveness and the innovation that drives it  These challenges transcend national borders;  low costs of entry to cyberspace and the ability to establish an anonymous virtual presence can also  lead to “safe havens” for criminals, with or without a state’s knowledge  Cybersecurity threats can even  endanger international peace and security more broadly, as traditional forms of conflict are extended  into cyberspace    4?
Our policies flow from a commitment to both preserving the best of cyberspace and safeguarding our  principles  Our international cyberspace policy reflects our core commitments to fundamental freedoms,  privacy, and the free flow of information   Fundamental Freedoms  Our commitment to freedom of expression and association is abiding, but does  not come at the expense of public safety or the protection of our citizens  Among these civil liberties,  recognized internationally as “fundamental freedoms,” the ability to seek, receive and impart information  and ideas through any medium and regardless of frontiers has never been more relevant  As a nation, we  are not blind to those Internet users with malevolent intentions, but recognize that exceptions to free  speech in cyberspace must also be narrowly tailored  For example, child pornography, inciting imminent  violence, or organizing an act of terrorism have no place in any society, and thus, they have no place on  the Internet  Nonetheless, the United States will continue to combat them in a manner consistent with  our core values—treating these issues specifically, and not as referenda on the Internet’s value to society   Privacy  Our strategy marries our obligation to protect our citizens and interests with our commitment  to privacy  As citizens increasingly engage via the Internet in their public and private lives, they have  expectations for privacy: individuals should be able to understand how their personal data may be  used, and be confident that it will be handled fairly  Likewise, they expect to be protected from fraud,  theft, and threats to personal safety that lurk online—and expect law enforcement to use all the tools  at their disposal, pursuant to law, to track and prosecute those who would use the Internet to exploit  others  The United States is committed to ensuring balance on both sides of this equation, by giving law  enforcement appropriate investigative authorities it requires, while protecting individual rights through  appropriate judicial review and oversight to ensure consistency with the rule of law   Free Flow of Information  States do not, and should not have to choose between the free flow of infor- mation and the security of their networks  The best cybersecurity solutions are dynamic and adaptable,  with minimal impact on network performance  These tools secure systems without crippling innovation,  suppressing freedom of expression or association, or impeding global interoperability  In contrast, we see  other approaches—such as national-level filters and firewalls—as providing only an illusion of security  while hampering the effectiveness and growth of the Internet as an open, interoperable, secure, and  reliable medium of exchange  The same is true commercially; cyberspace must remain a level playing  field that rewards innovation, entrepreneurship, and industriousness, not a venue where states arbi- trarily disrupt the free flow of information to create unfair advantage  The United States is committed to  international initiatives and standards that enhance cybersecurity while safeguarding free trade and the  broader free flow of information, recognizing our global responsibilities, as well as our national needs    Too often, such principles are characterized as incompatible with effective law enforcement, anonymity,  the protection of children and secure infrastructure  In reality, good cybersecurity can enhance privacy,  and effective law enforcement targeting widely-recognized illegal behavior can protect fundamental  freedoms  The rule of law—a civil order in which fidelity to laws safeguards people and interests; brings  stability to global markets; and holds malevolent actors to account internationally—both supports our  national security and advances our common values   5?
Cyberspace’s future  Envision a future in which reliable access to the Internet is available from nearly any point on the globe,  at a price that businesses and families can afford  Computers can communicate with one another across  a seamless landscape of global networks permitting trusted, instantaneous communication with friends  and colleagues down the block or around the world  Content is offered in local languages and flows  freely beyond national borders, as improvements in digital translation open to millions a wealth of  knowledge, new ideas, and rich debates  New technologies improving agriculture or promoting public  health are shared with those in greatest need, and difficult problems benefit from global collaboration  among experts and innovators  This, in part, is the future of cyberspace that the United States seeks—and  the future we will work to realize   In this future, individuals and businesses can quickly and easily obtain the tools necessary to set up their  own presence online; domain names and addresses are available, secure, and properly maintained,  without onerous licenses or unreasonable disclosures of personal information  The best engineers work  together internationally to develop new standards for information systems that make networks faster  and more reliable, catalyzing innovation and expanding accessibility  High-tech industry works with its  customers to provide software, hardware, and services that are more secure, more reliable, and more  responsive to their needs   It is a future in which universities and companies are free to research and develop new concepts and  products because they know their intellectual property and valuable data are safe, even on shared  networks  Individuals know the threats to their personal computers, and can take easy-to-use measures  to protect their systems  Private-sector companies also take a responsibility for their network hygiene,  knowing that in so doing, they protect their investments  When cybersecurity incidents demand  government action, officials can detect those threats early and share data in real-time to mitigate the  spread of malware or minimize the impact of a major disruption—all while preserving the broader free  flow of information  When a crime is committed internationally, law enforcement agencies are able to  collaborate to safeguard and share evidence and bring individuals to justice    This future promises not just greater prosperity and more reliable networks, but enhanced international  security and a more sustainable peace  In it, states act as responsible parties in cyberspace—whether  configuring networks in ways that will spare others disruption, or inhibiting criminals from using the  Internet to operate from safe havens  States know that networked infrastructure must be protected,  and they take measures to secure it from disruption and sabotage  They continue to collaborate bilater- ally, multilaterally, and internationally to bring more of the world into the information age and into the  consensus of states that seek to preserve the Internet and its core characteristics    The United States and a growing number of partners have laid the foundation for this future already  But  it is not a foregone conclusion, and we cannot build it alone  Though progress may be slow and resource- intensive, the international community must join together in support of this long-term investment  We  must do so with the clear understanding that this vision of cyberspace serves national interests as much  as shared international aims  The measure of our success will be another half-century of information  technology as transformational as the last, as we begin to realize fully the benefits—and minimize the  risks—of global interconnection   7?
InTernaTIonal  sTraTegy  for  CyBersPaCe  The Future We Seek The cyberspace environment that we seek rewards innovation and empowers individuals; it connects  individuals and strengthens communities; it builds better governments and expands accountability;  it safeguards fundamental freedoms and enhances personal privacy; it builds understanding, clarifies  norms of behavior, and enhances national and international security  To sustain this environment,  international collaboration is more than a best practice; it is a first principle   Our Goal  The United States will work internationally to promote an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable   information and communications infrastructure that supports international trade and commerce,  strengthens international security, and fosters free expression and innovation  To achieve that goal, we will  build and sustain an environment in which norms of responsible behavior guide states’ actions, sustain  partnerships, and support the rule of law in cyberspace    Open and Interoperable: A Cyberspace That Empowers At the core of digital innovation is the ability to add new functionality to networked machines  The  openness of digital systems explains their explosive growth, rapid development, and enduring impor- tance  Networked technology’s basic tools are steadily increasing in availability and decreasing in price,  as computer and Internet access have spread to every nation  To continue to serve the needs of an  ever-growing wired population, manufacturers of hardware and operating systems must continue to  empower the widest possible range of developers across the globe  As companies continue to drive  innovation in the development of proprietary software, we also applaud the vibrancy of the open-source  software movement, giving developers and consumers the choice of community-driven solutions to  meet their needs   The United States supports an Internet with end-to-end interoperability, which allows people world- wide to connect to knowledge, ideas, and one another through technology that meets their needs   The free flow of information depends on interoperability—a principle affirmed by 174 nations in the  Tunis Commitment of the World Summit on the Information Society  The alternative to global openness  and interoperability is a fragmented Internet, where large swaths of the world’s population would be  denied access to sophisticated applications and rich content because of a few nations’ political interests   The collaborative development of consensus-based international standards for information and com- munication technology is a key part of preserving openness and interoperability, growing our digital  economies, and moving our societies forward   Secure and Reliable: A Cyberspace That Endures For cyberspace as we know it to endure, our networked systems must retain our trust  Users need to  have confidence that their data will be secure in transit and storage, as well as reliable in delivery  An  effective strategy will require action on many fronts, with shared responsibility at every level of society,  from the end-user up through collaboration among nation-states   8?
CyBersPaCe’s  fuTure  Vulnerability reduction will require robust technical standards and solutions, effective incident manage- ment, trustworthy hardware and software, and secure supply chains  Risk reduction on a global scale  will require effective law enforcement; internationally agreed norms of state behavior; measures that  build confidence and enhance transparency; active, informed diplomacy; and appropriate deterrence   Finally, incident response will require increased collaboration and technical information sharing with the  private sector and international community  This work cannot be fully addressed by any single nation  or sector alone; it is a responsibility and duty that every nation, and its people, all share   Network stability is a cornerstone of our global prosperity, and securing those networks is more than  strictly a technical matter  Economically, we must advance sustainable growth and invest in infrastructure  at home and abroad, while incentivizing network reliability and clarifying the obligations of firms and  states  Politically, we must help to maintain an environment of respect for technical infrastructure, so  disputes do not become excuses to disrupt and degrade networks  Socially, we must make end-users  aware of their responsibilities to maintain and operate their devices in a safe and secure manner    Stability Through Norms The United States will work with like-minded states to establish an environment of expectations, or  norms of behavior, that ground foreign and defense policies and guide international partnerships  The  last two decades have seen the swift and unprecedented growth of the Internet as a social medium;  the growing reliance of societies on networked information systems to control critical infrastructures  and communications systems essential to modern life; and increasing evidence that governments are  seeking to exercise traditional national power through cyberspace  These events have not been matched  by clearly agreed-upon norms for acceptable state behavior in cyberspace  To bridge that gap, we will  work to build a consensus on what constitutes acceptable behavior, and a partnership among those  who view the functioning of these systems as essential to the national and collective interest   The Role of Norms  In other spheres of international relations, shared understandings about accept- able behavior have enhanced stability and provided a basis for international action when corrective  measures are required  Adherence to such norms brings predictability to state conduct, helping prevent  the misunderstandings that could lead to conflict   The development of norms for state conduct in cyberspace does not require a reinvention of customary  international law, nor does it render existing international norms obsolete  Long-standing international  norms guiding state behavior—in times of peace and conflict—also apply in cyberspace  Nonetheless,  unique attributes of networked technology require additional work to clarify how these norms apply  and what additional understandings might be necessary to supplement them  We will continue to work  internationally to forge consensus regarding how norms of behavior apply to cyberspace, with the  understanding that an important first step in such efforts is applying the broad expectations of peaceful  and just interstate conduct to cyberspace   9?
InTernaTIonal  sTraTegy  for  CyBersPaCe  The Basis for Norms  Rules that promote order and peace, advance basic human dignity, and promote  freedom in economic competition are essential to any international environment  These principles pro- vide a basic roadmap for how states can meet their traditional international obligations in cyberspace  and, in many cases, reflect duties of states that apply regardless of context  The existing principles that  should support cyberspace norms include:   • Upholding Fundamental Freedoms:  States must respect fundamental freedoms of expression   and association, online as well as off    • Respect for Property:  States should in their undertakings and through domestic laws respect   intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, trademarks, and copyrights    • Valuing Privacy:  Individuals should be protected from arbitrary or unlawful state interference   with their privacy when they use the Internet    • Protection from Crime:  States must identify and prosecute cybercriminals, to ensure laws and  practices deny criminals safe havens, and cooperate with international criminal investigations  in a timely manner    • Right of Self-Defense:  Consistent with the United Nations Charter, states have an inherent   right to self-defense that may be triggered by certain aggressive acts in cyberspace   Deriving from these traditional principles of interstate conduct are responsibilities more specific to  cyberspace, focused in particular on preserving global network functionality and improving cyberse- curity  Many of these responsibilities are rooted in the technical realities of the Internet  Because the  Internet’s core functionality relies on systems of trust (such as the Border Gateway Protocol), states  need to recognize the international implications of their technical decisions, and act with respect for  one another’s networks and the broader Internet  Likewise, in designing the next generation of these  systems, we must advance the common interest by supporting the soundest technical standards and  governance structures, rather than those that will simply enhance national prestige or political control   Emerging norms, also essential to this space, include:   • Global Interoperability:  States should act within their authorities to help ensure the end-to-  end interoperability of an Internet accessible to all    • Network Stability:  States should respect the free flow of information in national network  configurations, ensuring they do not arbitrarily interfere with internationally interconnected  infrastructure    • Reliable Access:  States should not arbitrarily deprive or disrupt individuals’ access to the   Internet or other networked technologies    • Multi-stakeholder Governance:  Internet governance efforts must not be limited to govern-  ments, but should include all appropriate stakeholders    • Cybersecurity Due Diligence:  States should recognize and act on their responsibility to protect   information infrastructures and secure national systems from damage or misuse   10?
CyBersPaCe’s  fuTure  While cyberspace is a dynamic environment, international behavior in it must be grounded in the  principles of responsible domestic governance, peaceful interstate conduct, and reliable network  management  As these ideas develop, the United States will foster and participate fully in discussions,  advancing a principled approach to Internet policy-making and developing shared understandings in  fora appropriate to each issue   Our Role in Cyberspace’s Future To realize this future and help promulgate positive norms, the United States will combine diplomacy,  defense, and development to enhance prosperity, security, and openness so all can benefit from net- worked technology  These three approaches are central to our efforts internationally  In the latter half of  the 20th century, the United States helped forge a new post-war architecture of international economic  and security cooperation  In the 21st century, we will work to realize this vision of a peaceful and reliable  cyberspace in that same spirit of cooperation and collective responsibility   Diplomacy: Strengthening Partnerships Extending the principles of peace and security to cyberspace—while preserving its benefits and charac- ter—will require strengthened partnerships and expanded initiatives  We will engage the international  community in frank and urgent dialogue, to build consensus around principles of responsible behavior  in cyberspace and the actions necessary, both domestically and as an international community, to build  a system of cyberspace stability   Diplomatic Objective  The United States will work to create incentives for, and build consensus around, an international envi- ronment in which states—recognizing the intrinsic value of an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable  cyberspace—work together and act as responsible stakeholders    Strengthening Partnerships Through our international relationships and affiliations, we will seek to ensure that as many stakeholders  as possible are included in this vision of cyberspace precisely because of its economic, social, political,  and security benefits  These efforts will be supported by meaningful collaboration with the private  sector at home and abroad    Distributed systems require distributed action, and no single institution, document, arrangement, or  instrument could suffice in addressing the needs of our networked world  From end-users, private-sector  hardware and software vendors, and Internet service providers, to regional, multilateral, and multi- stakeholder organizations—all are important in helping cyberspace meet its full potential    In the international arena in particular, states have an enduring role to play in preserving peace and  stability, empowering innovation, safeguarding economic and national security interests, and protecting  and promoting the individual rights of citizens  In our international relations, the United States will work  to establish an environment of international expectations that anchor foreign and defense policies and  strengthen our international relationships    11?
InTernaTIonal  sTraTegy  for  CyBersPaCe  Bilateral and Multilateral Partnerships  We will work bilaterally with nations to build collaboration on  cyberspace issues important to our governments and our peoples  Building broad international under- standing about cyberspace norms of behavior must begin with clear agreement among like-minded  countries  We will seek a broad community of partners in these efforts, and will include cyberspace  issues in a wide range of bilateral dialogues, at all levels of government and across a wide range of our  activities  We will advance common action on cyberspace’s emerging challenges, while building on those  enforcement tools and approaches already enjoying success  Furthermore, we will actively engage the  developing world, and ensure that emerging voices on these issues are heard   International and Multi-stakeholder Organizations  Regional organizations have been particularly  effective at tackling cybersecurity problems specific to their members  They will play an increasingly  important role in developing and applying norms of behavior  We will continue to use our membership  in these organizations, as well as in broader international organizations, to develop productive agendas  that are appropriate to each organization’s expertise and that realize concrete benefits for members  In  Internet governance policy, important steps have been made to ensure responsiveness and international  representation in key organizations  The United States salutes those efforts, and will continue to recog- nize the unique contribution of such fora that represent the entire Internet community by integrating  the private sector, civil society, academia, as well as governments in a multi-stakeholder environment    Private Sector Collaboration  Although the private sector already plays an important role in international  and multi-stakeholder organizations, we will continue to leverage existing partnership mechanisms to  engage with industry partners  In particular, we will work closely with infrastructure owners and opera- tors—who are responsible for the majority of network functionality—to expand initiatives to secure the  network ecosystem, preserve the benefits and character of cyberspace, avoid unnecessary impediments  to technological evolution, and extend principles of peace and security  We also seek the private sector’s  participation in Internet governance as essential to upholding its multi-stakeholder character, and will  continue to advocate for inclusiveness in fora that take up such issues   Defense: Dissuading and Deterring  The United States will defend its networks, whether the threat comes from terrorists, cybercriminals, or  states and their proxies  Just as importantly, we will seek to encourage good actors and dissuade and  deter those who threaten peace and stability through actions in cyberspace  We will do so with over- lapping policies that combine national and international network resilience with vigilance and a range  of credible response options  In all our defense endeavors, we will protect civil liberties and privacy in  accordance with our laws and principles   Defense Objective  The United States will, along with other nations, encourage responsible behavior and oppose those who  would seek to disrupt networks and systems, dissuading and deterring malicious actors, and reserving the  right to defend these vital national assets as necessary and appropriate    12?
CyBersPaCe’s  fuTure  Dissuasion Protecting networks of such great value requires robust defensive capabilities  The United States will  continue to strengthen our network defenses and our ability to withstand and recover from disrup- tions and other attacks  For those more sophisticated attacks that do create damage, we will act on  well-developed response plans to isolate and mitigate disruption to our machines, limiting effects on  our networks, and potential cascade effects beyond them   Strength at Home  Ensuring the resilience of our networks and information systems requires collective  and concerted national action that spans the whole of government, in collaboration with the private sec- tor and individual citizens  For a decade, the United States has been fostering a culture of cybersecurity  and an effective apparatus for risk mitigation and incident response  We continue to emphasize that  systematically adopting sound information technology practices—across the public and private sec- tors—will reduce our Nation’s vulnerabilities and strengthen networks and systems  We are also making  steady progress towards shared situational awareness of network vulnerabilities and risks among public  and private sector networks  We have built new initiatives through our national computer security inci- dent response team to share information among government, key industries, our critical infrastructure  sectors, and other stakeholders  And we continually seek new ways to strengthen our partnership with  the private sector to enhance the security of the systems on which we both rely    Strength Abroad  This model of defense has been successfully shared internationally through education,  training and ongoing operational and policy relationships  Today, through existing and developing  collaborations in the technical and military defense arenas, nations share an unprecedented ability to  recognize and respond to incidents—a crucial step in denying would-be attackers the ability to do lasting  damage to our national and international networks  However, a globally distributed network requires  globally distributed early warning capabilities  We must continue to produce new computer security  incident response capabilities globally, and to facilitate their interconnection and enhanced computer  network defense  The United States has a shared interest in assisting less developed nations to build  capacity for defense, and in collaboration with our partners, will intensify our focus on this area  Building  relationships with friends and allies will increase collective security across the international community   Deterrence The United States will ensure that the risks associated with attacking or exploiting our networks vastly  outweigh the potential benefits  We fully recognize that cyberspace activities can have effects extending  beyond networks; such events may require responses in self-defense  Likewise, interconnected networks  link nations more closely, so an attack on one nation’s networks may have impact far beyond its borders   In the case of criminals and other non-state actors who would threaten our national and economic secu- rity, domestic deterrence requires all states have processes that permit them to investigate, apprehend,  and prosecute those who intrude or disrupt networks at home or abroad  Internationally, law enforce- ment organizations must work in concert with one another whenever possible to freeze perishable  data vital to ongoing investigations, to work with legislatures and justice ministries to harmonize their  approaches, and to promote due process and the rule of law—all key tenets of the Budapest Convention  on Cybercrime   13?
InTernaTIonal  sTraTegy  for  CyBersPaCe  When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other  threat to our country  All states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain  hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with  our military treaty partners  We reserve the right to use all necessary means—diplomatic, informational,  military, and economic—as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to  defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests  In so doing, we will exhaust all options  before military force whenever we can; will carefully weigh the costs and risks of action against the costs  of inaction; and will act in a way that reflects our values and strengthens our legitimacy, seeking broad  international support whenever possible    Development: Building Prosperity and Security The United States will continue to demonstrate our conviction that the benefits of a connected world  are universal  The virtues of an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable cyberspace should be more  available than they are today, and as the world’s leading information economy, the United States is  committed to ensuring others benefit from our technical resources and expertise    Our Nation can and will play an active role in providing the knowledge and capacity to build and secure  new and existing digital systems, and in so doing, build consensus among states to behave as respon- sible stakeholders  Building capacity to realize these goals is not a short-term expenditure, but a wise  long-term investment and a commitment on the part of our government for continued engagement    Development Objective  The United States will facilitate cybersecurity capacity-building abroad, bilaterally and through multilateral  organizations, so that each country has the means to protect its digital infrastructure, strengthen global net- works, and build closer partnerships in the consensus for open, interoperable, secure, and reliable networks    Building Technical Capacity Access to networked technology is increasingly a basic need for development  Governments and indus- try have made a number of meaningful steps to enhance connectivity to end-users across un-served  or underserved regions  International information infrastructures continue to mature and expand,  providing more nations with the opportunity to access the global flow of information  The growth of the  networks worldwide, and expansion of access to them, enriches the world community, yet also presents  new challenges and opportunities for collaboration on issues of traditional and cybersecurity  Much of  this capacity will result from private-sector investment, and the United States will work with govern- ments and industry to build a climate friendly to those efforts, and in which they can be leveraged to  address countries’ core development needs   14?
CyBersPaCe’s  fuTure  Governments are a major determinant of whether this new connectivity produces positive outcomes or  wastes its potential  Those states that have benefitted most from our capacity-building efforts are those  that embrace technology to build prosperity and enhance social cohesion, rather than restrict access  for the purposes of political control  For that reason, technical projects that the United States supports  will by design enhance security and commerce, safeguard the free flow of information, and promote  the global interoperability of networks   Building Cybersecurity Capacity Prosperity cannot be built on a foundation of fear and unreliability, and the United States is committed  to helping build cybersecurity capacity alongside states’ own technological development  Enhancing  national-level cybersecurity among developing nations is of immediate and long-term benefit, as more  states are equipped to confront threats emanating from within their borders and in turn, build confi- dence in globally interconnected networks and cooperate across borders to combat criminal misuse of  information technologies  It is also essential to cultivating dynamic, international research communities  able to take on next-generation challenges to cybersecurity    Acknowledging that cybersecurity is a global issue that must be addressed with national efforts on the  part of all countries, we will expand and regularize initiatives focused on cybersecurity capacity build- ing—with enhanced focus on awareness-raising, legal and technical training, and support for policy  development  Such programs must address more than purely technology issues; we will work with states  to recognize the breadth of the cybersecurity challenge, assist them in developing their own strategies,  and build capacity across the whole range of sectors—from network security and the establishment of  Computer Emergency Readiness Teams (CERTs), to international law enforcement and defense collabo- ration, to productive relationships with the domestic and international private sector and civil society    Building Policy Relationships The United States’ capacity-building assistance is envisioned as an investment, a commitment, and  an important opportunity for dialogue and partnership  As countries develop a stake in cyberspace  issues, we intend our dialogues to mature from capacity-building to active economic, technical, law  enforcement, defense and diplomatic collaboration on issues of mutual concern  We will also facilitate  relationships among countries developing cybersecurity capacity—using both regional fora and techni- cal bodies possessing specialized expertise—and will continue to promote the sharing of best practices,  lessons learned, and international technical exchanges   15?
Policy Priorities  The United States will continue to take action to help build and sustain open, interoperable, secure, and  reliable networks at home and abroad, both for our citizens and others in the global community  Our  approach is guided by the fundamental principles, driven by the overarching goal, and sustained by  the policies outlined in this document—together they form the basis of the United States’ international  cyberspace strategy   To fully realize this future in which cyberspace lives up to its potential for all, the United States  Government organizes its activities across seven interdependent areas of activity, each demanding  collaboration within our government, with international partners, and with the private sector  Taken as  a whole, they form the action lines of our strategic framework   For the many departments and agencies of the United States Government already engaged in these  activities, they provide reinforcement to the important work already underway  For those developing  implementation plans to carry out their specific responsibilities in cyberspace, they provide context  and ensure unity of effort  The policy priorities outlined here call for and guide those specific actions,  highlighting areas of past, present and future emphasis that demand concerted attention and resources  at the national level    Economy: Promoting International Standards and Innovative,   Open Markets To ensure that cyberspace continues to serve the needs of our economies and innovators, we will:   • Sustain a free-trade environment that encourages technological innovation on accessible,  globally linked networks.
Just as the free flow of information is critical to the functioning of  our networks, free trade helps support innovation and market growth in the information age   The global embrace of the Internet can largely be traced to the spread of lower-cost and globally  available computers and network technology  Competition in these markets drives innovation,  while a free-trade environment enables manufacturers to keep prices competitive and standards  high  Respecting the international standards of technology development and trade is an essen- tial part of sustaining open markets, and enables leading-edge technology companies to rapidly  deliver the benefits of their innovative products and services  Over the next few decades, the  globalization of technology manufacturing will only increase, with substantial benefits for our  networks and consumers  The United States will work to sustain that free-trade environment,  particularly in support of the high-tech sector, to ensure future innovation    • Protect intellectual property, including commercial trade secrets, from theft.
The same  global networks that power innovation also open up new avenues for industrial espionage and  the theft of intellectual property and commercial information  Cyberspace can be used to steal  an unprecedented volume of information from businesses, universities, and government agen- cies; such stolen information and technology can equal billions of dollars of lost value  Individual   17?
InTernaTIonal  sTraTegy  for  CyBersPaCe  incidents often go unreported or undetected  Results can range from unfair competition to  the bankrupting of entire firms, and the national impact may be orders of magnitude larger   The persistent theft of intellectual property, whether by criminals, foreign firms, or state actors  working on their behalf, can erode competitiveness in the global economy, and businesses’  opportunities to innovate  The United States will take measures to identify and respond to such  actions to help build an international environment that recognizes such acts as unlawful and  impermissible, and hold such actors accountable    • Ensure the primacy of interoperable and secure technical standards, determined by tech- nical experts.
Developing international, voluntary, consensus-based cybersecurity standards  and deploying products, processes, and services based upon such standards are the basis  of an interoperable, secure and resilient global infrastructure  The public and private sectors  must work together to develop, maintain, and implement these standards and support the  development of international standards and conformity assessment schemes that prevent  barriers to international trade and commerce  International cybersecurity standardization, and  its voluntary and consensus-based processes, serves collective interests  They foster innovation;  facilitate interoperability, security, and resiliency; improve trust in online transactions; and spur  competition in global markets  The United States will foster collaboration between the public  and private sector to ensure the promulgation of international standards-based requirements  for products and services    Protecting Our Networks: Enhancing Security, Reliability, and  Resiliency Because strong cybersecurity is critical to national and economic security in the broadest sense, we will:   • Promote cyberspace cooperation, particularly on norms of behavior for states and cyber- security, bilaterally and in a range of multilateral organizations and multinational part- nerships.
An increasing number of international organizations are taking up cybersecurity and  other cyberspace issues, and the United States continues to promote this important work, build- ing cyberspace into their range of work to meet the needs of their varied memberships  We have  worked to include relevant cyberspace issues on the agenda at the Organization of American  States (OAS), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum (ARF), the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization (APEC), the Organization for Cooperation and  Security in Europe (OSCE), the African Union (AU), the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development (OECD), the Group of Eight (G-8), the European Union (EU), the United  Nations (U N ), and the Council of Europe, and to ensure that work is supported by an effective  institutional framework  The United States will continue, in these and other fora, to consolidate  regional and international consensus on key cyberspace activities, including norms  We will  also look to fora that enable multi-stakeholder collaboration and consensus building, to further  elaborate the Internet policy principles outlined in this document  We welcome the expansion  of this work to geographic regions currently underrepresented in the dialogue—most notably  Africa and the Middle East—to further our interest in building worldwide capacity   18?
PolICy  PrIorITIes   • Reduce intrusions into and disruptions of U.S. networks.
Unauthorized network intrusions  threaten the integrity of economies and undermine national security  Agencies across the United  States Government are collaborating, together with the private sector, to protect innovation  from industrial espionage, to protect Federal, state, and local government networks, to protect  military operations from degraded operating environments, and to secure critical infrastruc- ture against intrusions and attacks—particularly those on energy, transportation, or financial  systems, and the defense industrial base  The United States will pursue a broad international  consensus of states that recognize the importance of respect for property and network stabil- ity, and will back up that conviction with our own and our partners’ willingness to defend our  networks from acts that would compromise them     • Ensure robust incident management, resiliency, and recovery capabilities for information  infrastructure.
In an interconnected global environment, weak security in one nation’s systems  compounds the risk to others  No one nation can have full insight into the world’s networks; we  have an obligation to share our insights about our own networks and collaborate with others  when events might threaten us all  As we continue to build and enhance our own response  capabilities, we will work with other countries to expand the international networks that support  greater global situational awareness and incident response—including between government  and industry  The United States Government actively participates in watch, warning, and inci- dent response through exchanging information with trusted networks of international partners   We will expand these capabilities through international collaboration to enhance overall resil- ience  The United States will also work to engage international participation in cybersecurity  exercises, to elevate and strengthen established operating procedures with our partners     • Improve the security of the high-tech supply chain, in consultation with industry.
The oper- ation of critical networks and information infrastructures depends on the assured availability of  trustworthy hardware and software  Vulnerabilities in the supply chain can enable attacks on  the integrity, availability, or confidentiality of networks and the data they contain  Exploitation  of these vulnerabilities impairs economic performance and national security  The United States  will work with industry and international partners to develop best practices for protecting the  integrity of information systems and critical infrastructure  In this way, we will greatly enhance  the security of the globalized supply chains on which free and open trade depend   Law Enforcement: Extending Collaboration and the Rule of Law To enhance confidence in cyberspace and pursue those who would exploit online systems, we will:   • Participate fully in international cybercrime policy development.
The United States is com- mitted to participating actively in discussions about how international norms and measures  on cybercrime are developed bilaterally and multilaterally, in fora with proven expertise and a  history of promoting effective cybercrime policies  These conversations will incorporate existing  efforts, like how to extend the reach of institutions like the Budapest Convention  The United  States will build these efforts upon the successful partnerships between national law enforce- ment agencies and the productive policy dialogues that we currently enjoy, cultivating a sense  of responsibility among states joining this effort   19?

The United States and our allies regularly depend upon cooperation and assistance  from other countries when investigating and prosecuting cybercrime cases  This cooperation is  most effective and meaningful when the countries have common cybercrime laws, which facili- tates evidence-sharing, extradition, and other types of coordination  The Budapest Convention  on Cybercrime provides countries with a model for drafting and updating their current laws,  and it has proven to be an effective mechanism for enhancing international cooperation in  cybercrime cases  The United States will continue to encourage other countries to become par- ties to the Convention and will help current non-parties use the Convention as a basis for their  own laws, easing bilateral cooperation in the short term, and preparing them for the possibility  of accession to the Convention in the long term    • Focus cybercrime laws on combating illegal activities, not restricting access to the  Internet.
Criminal behavior in cyberspace should be met with effective law enforcement, not  policies that restrict legitimate access to or content on the Internet  To advance this goal, the  United States Government works on a bilateral and multilateral basis to ensure that countries  recognize that online crimes should be approached by focusing on preventing crime and catch- ing and punishing offenders, rather than by broadly limiting access to the Internet, as a broad  limitation of access would affect innocent Internet users as well  As the United States and our  partners engage in dialogue and help build capacity among law enforcement organizations  worldwide, we will integrate this approach, uniting protection of privacy, fundamental freedoms,  and innovation with collaboration to combat crimes in cyberspace     • Deny terrorists and other criminals the ability to exploit the Internet for operational plan- ning, financing, or attacks.
The United States has a variety of international capacity-building  and training programs on cybercrime, helping law enforcement and legislators develop effec- tive legal frameworks and expertise to investigate and prosecute terrorist and other criminal  misuse of the Internet  Preventing terrorists from enhancing capabilities through “hackers for  hire” and organized crime tools is an important priority for the international community, and  demands effective cybercrime laws  The United States is committed to tracking and disrupting  terrorist and cybercrime finance networks through technical tools and international cooperation  frameworks such as the Financial Action Task Force    Military: Preparing for 21st Century Security Challenges Since our commitment to defend our citizens, allies, and interests extends to wherever they might be  threatened, we will:   • Recognize and adapt to the military’s increasing need for reliable and secure networks.
We recognize that our armed forces increasingly depend on the networks that support them,  and we will work to ensure that our military remains fully equipped to operate even in an  environment where others might seek to disrupt its systems, or other infrastructure vital to  national defense  Like all nations, the United States has a compelling interest in defending its  vital national assets, as well as our core principles and values, and we are committed to defend- ing against those who would attempt to impede our ability to do so   20?
Cybersecurity cannot be achieved by any one nation alone, and greater levels of international  cooperation are needed to confront those actors who would seek to disrupt or exploit our  networks   This effort begins by acknowledging that the interconnected nature of networked  systems of our closest allies, such as those of NATO and its member states, creates opportuni- ties and new risks  Moving forward, the United States will continue to work with the militaries  and civilian counterparts of our allies and partners to expand situational awareness and shared  warning systems, enhance our ability to work together in times of peace and crisis, and develop  the means and method of collective self-defense in cyberspace  Such military alliances and  partnerships will bolster our collective deterrence capabilities and strengthen our ability to  defend the United States against state and non-state actors    • Expand cyberspace cooperation with allies and partners to increase collective security.
The challenges of cyberspace also create opportunities to work in new ways with allied and  partner militaries  By developing a shared understanding of standard operating procedures, our  armed forces can enhance security through coordination and greater information exchange;  these engagements will diminish misperceptions about military activities and the potential for  escalatory behavior  Dialogues and best practice exchanges to enhance partner capabilities,  such as digital forensics, work force development, and network penetration and resiliency  testing will be important to this effort  The United States will work in close partnership with  like-minded states to leverage capabilities, reduce collective risk, and foster multi-stakeholder  initiatives to deter malicious activities in cyberspace    Internet Governance: Promoting Effective and Inclusive Structures To promote Internet governance structures that effectively serve the needs of all Internet users, we will:   • Prioritize openness and innovation on the Internet.
The ability to distribute information  efficiently on the Internet is at the very core of modern consumer, business, political, scientific,  and educational activity  Governments around the globe recognize the value of the Internet;  however, many of them place arbitrary restrictions on the free flow of information or use it to  suppress dissent or opposition activities  The method and enforcement of these restrictions  vary widely across countries, as do their justification, but we should not allow the Internet’s  governance or technical architecture to be reengineered to accommodate decisions that  violate fundamental freedoms, or unnecessarily stifle innovation  Effective, inclusive Internet  governance can help ensure acts grossly outside international norms of acceptable network  management are not compounded by a technical or governance structure that would enable  them  Preserving, enhancing, and increasing access to an open, global Internet is a clear policy  priority  The United States will continue to advance these goals through a variety of engage- ments, including outreach to appropriate multi-stakeholder institutions and organizations, and  to relevant intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations   21?
InTernaTIonal  sTraTegy  for  CyBersPaCe   • Preserve global network security and stability, including the domain name system (DNS).
Given the Internet’s importance to the world’s economy, it is essential that this network of  networks and its underlying infrastructure, the DNS, remain stable and secure  To ensure this  continued stability and security, it is imperative that we and the rest of the world continue to  recognize the contributions of its full range of stakeholders, particularly those organizations and  technical experts vital to the technical operation of the Internet  The United States recognizes  that the effective coordination of these resources has facilitated the Internet’s success, and will  continue to support those effective, multi-stakeholder processes     • Promote and enhance multi-stakeholder venues for the discussion of Internet gover- nance issues.
The very architecture of the Internet embodies a mode of social and technical  organization which is decentralized, cooperative, and layered  Each of these characteristics is  fundamental to the benefits the Internet has brought  That architecture fuels the freedom of  innovation that enables economic growth  It fuels the freedom of expression and association  that enables social and political growth and the functioning of democratic societies worldwide   The United States stands firm in our conviction that when the international community meets  to discuss the range of Internet governance issues, these conversations must take place in  a multi-stakeholder manner; we will continue to support successful venues like the Internet  Governance Forum, which embodies the open and inclusive nature of the Internet itself by  allowing nongovernment stakeholders to contribute to the discussion on equal footing with  governments   International Development: Building Capacity, Security, and  Prosperity To promote the benefits of networked technology globally, enhance the reliability of our shared net- works, and build the community of responsible stakeholders in cyberspace, we will:   • Provide the necessary knowledge, training, and other resources to countries seeking to  build technical and cybersecurity capacity.
The benefits of an interconnected world should  not be limited by national borders  For over a decade the United States has helped bridge that  gap, supporting a variety of programs to help other nations gain the resources and skills to build  core capacities in technology and cybersecurity  Our goal is to help other states learn from our  experience, and in particular to build cybersecurity into their national technical development   Because the needs are many and diverse, our programs range from supporting national capa- bilities for incident management; to building public/private partnerships; to enhancing control  systems security; to drafting effective laws to investigate and prosecute cybercrime; to develop- ing and implementing programs to raise cybersecurity awareness and build a national culture  of cybersecurity  Our work has taken place bilaterally, through foreign assistance, as well in  partnership with innovative public-private initiatives like the United States Telecommunications  Training Institute  In recent years, we have helped make this work a priority at multilateral fora  such as the OAS, APEC, and the U N  The United States will expand these collaborations, work  in-country to support private-sector investment in capacity, draw attention to this critical need,  and work to build new collaborations in the coming years    22?
PolICy  PrIorITIes   • Continually develop and regularly share international cybersecurity best practices.
Today,  nations no longer need to develop cybersecurity capacity exclusively through a process of trial  and error  We have worked with dozens of other states and with numerous multilateral organiza- tions to develop and share best practices designed to help states make wiser investments and  develop more effective policies  The United States will continue to identify, develop, and refine  best practices and technical standards in collaboration and close partnership with industry, and  will expand our efforts to promote awareness of and access to them  We will further promote  collaborative science and technology research to enhance cybersecurity tools and capabilities    • Enhance states’ ability to fight cybercrime—including training for law enforcement,  forensic specialists, jurists, and legislators.
Because criminal cases involving computer net- works often involve evidence and targets located overseas, governments regularly rely on one  another to provide often extensive technical and investigative assistance in matters relating to  serious crime and national security  Criminal threats can originate from any connected country,  and many countries need substantial help in developing the investigative capacities required  to collaborate in such investigations  By providing training on these issues, we develop critical  contacts and help promote law enforcement technical understanding  This engagement will  increase the prospects for effective law enforcement cooperation and reciprocal assistance  The  United States will continue to pursue this objective by providing training in numerous regions,  continuing our work in Africa, and with APEC, ASEAN, G-8, and the OAS    • Develop relationships with policymakers to enhance technical capacity building, provid- ing regular and ongoing contact with experts and their United States Government coun- terparts.
Over the last few years, a growing international community of policymakers focusing  on cyberspace issues has provided new avenues for dialogue, launched new development and  security initiatives, and strengthened countless bilateral relations  As we invest in developing  countries’ long-term future through technical and cybersecurity capacity-building, the United  States is committed to building those assistance relationships into closer partnerships on issues  of mutual concern  We have taken a lead role in convening fora, such as the Meridian Conference,  which fosters collaboration on critical information infrastructure protection issues  The United  States welcomes more states entering into the dialogue as they become increasingly invested  in the future of cyberspace, and will work to build enduring relationships among our experts  and policymakers    Internet Freedom: Supporting Fundamental Freedoms and Privacy To help secure fundamental freedoms as well as privacy in cyberspace, we will:    • Support civil society actors in achieving reliable, secure, and safe platforms for freedoms  of expression and association.
We encourage people all over the world to use digital media to  express opinions, share information, monitor elections, expose corruption, and organize social  and political movements, and denounce those who harass, unfairly arrest, threaten, or commit  violent acts against the people who use these technologies  Such cultures of fear discourage  others in the community from using new technologies to report, organize, and exchange ideas    23?
InTernaTIonal  sTraTegy  for  CyBersPaCe  The same protections must apply to Internet Service Providers and other providers of con- nectivity, who too often fall victim to legal regimes of intermediary liability that pass the role of  censoring legitimate speech down to companies  The United States will be a tireless advocate  of fundamental freedoms of speech and association through cyberspace; will work to empower  civil society actors, human rights advocates, and journalists in their use of digital media; and will  work to encourage governments to address real cyberspace threats, rather than impose upon  companies responsibilities of inappropriately limiting either freedom of expression or the free  flow of information    • Collaborate with civil society and nongovernment organizations to establish safeguards  protecting their Internet activity from unlawful digital intrusions.
Promoting cybersecu- rity among civil society and nongovernmental organizations helps ensure that freedoms of  speech and association are more widely enjoyed in the digital age  Cybersecurity is particularly  important for activists, advocates, and journalists on the front lines who may express unpopular  ideas and opinions, and who are frequently the victims of disruptions and intrusions into their  email accounts, websites, mobile phones, and data systems  The United States supports efforts  to empower these users to protect themselves, to help ensure their ability to exercise their free  expression and association rights on the new technologies of the 21st century    • Encourage international cooperation for effective commercial data privacy protections.
Protecting individual privacy is essential to maintaining the trust that sustains economic and  social uses of the Internet  The United States has a robust record of enforcement of its privacy  laws, as well as encouraging multi-stakeholder policy development  We are continuing to  strengthen the U S  commercial data privacy framework to keep pace with the rapid changes  presented by networked technologies  We recognize the role of applying general privacy  principles in the commercial context while maintaining the flexibility necessary for innovation   The United States will work toward building mutual recognition of laws that achieve the same  objectives and enforcement cooperation to protect privacy and promote innovation    • Ensure the end-to-end interoperability of an Internet accessible to all.
Users should have  confidence that the information they transmit over the Internet will be received as it was  intended, anywhere in the world  Equally important is the expectation that under normal cir- cumstances, data will flow across borders without regard for its national origin or destination   Ensuring the integrity of information as it flows over the Internet gives users confidence in the  network and keeps the Internet open as a reliable platform for innovation that drives growth in  the global economy and encourages the exchange of ideas among people around the world   The United States will continue to make clear the benefits of an Internet that is global in nature,  while opposing efforts to splinter this network into national intranets that deprive individuals  of content from abroad   24?
Moving forward  The benefits of networked technology should not be reserved to a privileged few nations, or a privileged  few within them  But connectivity is no end unto itself; it must be supported by a cyberspace that is  open to innovation, interoperable the world over, secure enough to earn people’s trust, and reliable  enough to support their work    Thirty years ago, few understood that something called the Internet would lead to a revolution in  how we work and live  In that short time, millions now owe their livelihoods—and even their lives—to  advances in networked technology  A billion more rely on it for everyday forms of social interaction   This technology propels society forward, accomplishing things previous generations scarcely thought  possible  For our part, the United States will continue to spark the creativity and imagination of our  people, and those around the world  We cannot know what the next great innovation will be, but are  committed to realizing a world in which it can take shape and flourish    This strategy is a roadmap allowing the United States Government’s departments and agencies to better  define and coordinate their role in our international cyberspace policy, to execute a specific way forward,  and to plan for future implementation  It is a call to the private sector, civil society, and end-users to  reinforce these efforts through partnership, awareness, and action  Most importantly, it is an invitation  to other states and peoples to join us in realizing this vision of prosperity, security, and openness in  our networked world  These ideals are central to preserving the cyberspace we know, and to creating,  together, the future we seek    25?
