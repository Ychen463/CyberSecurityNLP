PROTECT AND DEFEND YOUR ORGANIZATION.
When it comes to security breaches and cyber-attacks, it is often  not a matter of if an organization will experience an attack, but  when it will happen.
Yet, an overwhelming number of organizations  still feel ill-equipped to handle an attack and the need for skilled  cybersecurity professionals continues to grow exponentially.
To help address the global cybersecurity skills crisis head on,  ISACA has created Cybersecurity NexusTM (CSX).
CSX is helping  shape the future of cybersecurity through cutting-edge thought  leadership, as well as training and certification programs for the  professionals who are leading it there.
Building on the strength  of ISACA’s globally-recognized expertise, it gives cybersecurity  professionals a smarter way to keep organizations and their  information more secure.
With CSX, business leaders and cyber professionals can obtain the  knowledge, tools, guidance and connections to be at the forefront  of a vital and rapidly changing industry.
Because Cybersecurity  Nexus is at the center of everything that’s coming next.
“It is often not until  [businesses] have  been hit that they  realize there is an  issue and a need   to be proactive and   to put resources   into this area”  Jo Stewart-Rattray, CISA, CISM, CGEIT,   CRISC, FACS CP, director of information   security and IT assurance, BRM Holdich  Introducing CSX Skills-Based   Cybersecurity Training And   Performance-Based Certifications   More and more cybersecurity professionals are turning to  ISACA’s Cybersecurity NexusTM (CSX) for the knowledge, tools  and guidance they need to gain the skills and expertise to be  successful in their jobs.
And, when it comes to cybersecurity,  it’s not enough anymore to just show you have the knowledge,  it’s about proving you have the technical skills and ability to  do the job from day one.
Our new skills-based training and  performance-based certifications are designed to help you build,  test and showcase your skills in critical areas of cybersecurity.
CSX certifications are game-changers — the first vendor-neutral  cybersecurity certifications based on the testing and validation  of actual technical skill, ability and performance.
Whereas other  certifications available today test for knowledge in a question  and answer format, CSX training and exams are conducted in a  live, virtual “cyber lab” environment and test on whether or not  an individual has the skills and technical savvy to do the job.
Driven by PerformanScoreTM, a learning and development tool  that captures live feedback as the user performs specific tasks  in response to real-world scenarios, CSX certifications measure  skills and abilities against job role competencies.
With self-assessment tools and guidance on career management,  we’ll help you understand where you are now in your skills, where  you want to take your career, and what you need to do to get there.
Our holistic program starts with the knowledge-based  Cybersecurity Fundamentals Certificate for those who are new to  the profession or looking to change careers, and centers on our  performance-based certifications at the Practitioner, Specialist and  Expert levels.

Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals   4         Executive Summary   Report Conclusions   In 2017, the Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) and the Information Systems Security Association (ISSA) teamed up for the  second year in a row to look at the lives and experiences of cybersecurity professionals.
This year’s report is based on data  from a survey of 343 cybersecurity professionals and ISSA members.
Like 2016, this year has been eventful in terms of cybersecurity events.
Visible breaches occurred at organizations like SVR Tracking (540,000 records  exposed), Equals3 (590,000+ records exposed), BroadSoft (4,000,000 records exposed), and Equifax (143,000,000  records exposed).
According to a report from   Cybersecurity Ventures, ransomware damage is up 15x in two years as global damages are expected to exceed $5  billion in 2017, up from $325 million in 2015.
•  Recent threat intelligence from Check Point Software and Qihoo identified a new IoT botnet dubbed “reaper.”    Researchers claim that reaper is much more sophisticated than the Mirai IoT botnet used to attack DNS services at  Dyn that rendered many Internet sites inaccessible in 2016.
Some researchers believe that reaper could grow much  larger than Mirai and harness enough network bandwidth to take down critical services or large parts of the Internet.
The continuing cycle of threats and visible data breaches motivates organizations to bolster their cybersecurity defenses.
ESG’s annual IT spending intentions data for 2017 reveals:   •  Sixty-nine percent of organizations planned to increase cybersecurity spending in 2017.
This percentage is almost   identical to the percentage of organizations that increased cybersecurity spending in 2016 (70%).
•  Thirty-nine percent of organizations say that increasing cybersecurity protection is one of their highest business   initiatives driving IT spending in 2017.
•  Thirty-two percent of organizations say that strengthening cybersecurity tools and processes is one of their most   important IT initiatives in 2017.1   As in the 2016 report, the data presented here illustrates an escalating and dangerous game of cybersecurity “cat and  mouse.” Cyber-adversaries continue to develop creative tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for attacks.
Recognizing  the risk, large and small organizations are prioritizing and investing in cybersecurity defenses and oversight.
Cybersecurity professionals continue to reside on the frontline of this perpetual battle, tasked with applying limited  resources as countermeasures and defending their organizations against a constant barrage of cyber-attacks.
Many  organizations fight this fight with suboptimal forces—ESG research reveals that 45% of organizations claim to have a  problematic shortage of cybersecurity skills.2                                                                 1 Source: ESG Research Report, 2017 IT Spending Intentions Survey, March 2017.

Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals   5         Given this daunting responsibility, it’s natural to wonder just how well cybersecurity professionals are holding up.
Are they  prepared for this perpetual battle or has the pace and intensity of their jobs caused a state of professional burnout within  the cybersecurity ranks?
What is the impact on the organizations they work for?
To answer these questions, the Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) and the Information Systems Security Association (ISSA)  teamed up once again and initiated a primary research project in 2017 with the goal of capturing the voice and thoughts of  cybersecurity professionals on the state of their profession and gaining a perspective on situational analysis from those  closest to the fight.
In pursuit of this goal, ESG/ISSA surveyed 343 IT and information security professionals (and ISSA  members).
Survey respondents represented organizations of all sizes located in all parts of the world (see the  demographics section of this report for more details).
Based upon the data collected, the big change from last year is that the cybersecurity skills crisis is getting worse and  causing a rapidly widening business problem.
Consistent with last year, the majority of respondents continue to believe  that the cybersecurity skills shortage has had an impact on their organization and confirm that the cybersecurity skills  shortage is exacerbating the number of data breaches.
However, this year, these same organizations are significantly  falling behind in providing an adequate level of training, and a lack of training has taken the lead as the number one  contributing factor to security events.
This points to an important shift from a staffing gap to a training gap at all levels of  the organization, a consistent theme throughout this year’s report.
This report concludes (in order of the survey questionnaire):   •   Cybersecurity professional career paths follow a common pattern.
Nearly half (47%) of survey respondents got into   cybersecurity as a chance to use their skills and curiosity to pursue technical challenges, 37% state that a  cybersecurity career was a natural progression from an IT position, and 36% were attracted by the morality of the  profession.
Taken together, this data indicates that many cybersecurity workers come from a subsegment of IT  professionals who want to use their technical skills in the fight of good versus evil.
While this data is useful for  recruiting purposes, it also illustrates the limited pool of potential future cybersecurity professionals today.
The  cybersecurity industry must reach beyond this traditional base, promote cybersecurity as a career path, and educate a  broader population on cybersecurity career opportunities.
•  Cybersecurity professionals struggle to define their career paths.
This is likely due to the diversity of cybersecurity  focus areas, the lack of a well-defined, industry-standard cybersecurity career lifecycle map, and the rapid changes in  the cybersecurity field itself.
Business, IT, and cybersecurity managers, academics, and public policy leaders should  take note of today’s cybersecurity career morass and develop and promote more formal cybersecurity guidelines and  frameworks that can guide cybersecurity professionals in their career development in the future.
•  Cybersecurity professionals have solid ideas for skills advancement.
When asked how they improve their knowledge,  skills, and abilities (KSAs), 76% of cybersecurity professionals pointed to things like attending specific cybersecurity  training courses, participating in professional organizations (71%), and attending industry trade shows (53%).
Clearly,  survey respondents believe that interacting with other cybersecurity professionals is the best way to move ahead.
New cybersecurity professionals are often overwhelmed by the number of   certification options in the field, and some pursue multiple certifications because they believe that a business card full  of acronyms will lead to career success.
Beyond a CISSP, other certifications are more useful to highlight knowledge around cybersecurity sub-topics.

Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals   6         •  Cybersecurity professional job satisfaction depends upon culture and continuing education.
Beyond leading   compensation, cybersecurity professionals find job satisfaction from organizations that provide incentives for career  advancement, provide an opportunity to work with other skilled cybersecurity professionals, and support a strong  commitment to cybersecurity by business leaders.
•  Most cybersecurity professionals aren’t satisfied with their current job.
•  Most organizations are not providing the cybersecurity staff with adequate training.
While 96% of survey respondents  agree that keeping their skill set up to date is a cybersecurity career requirement, only 38% of those surveyed believe  that their organization is providing an appropriate level of training for them to keep up with business and IT risks.
This  training gap should be concerning to business, IT, and cybersecurity executives alike.
•  Cybersecurity pros are in high demand.
Nearly half (49%) of those surveyed are solicited to consider other   cybersecurity jobs at least once per week.
This isn’t surprising given the global cybersecurity skills shortage and high  demand for top talent.
Nearly one-third (31%) of survey respondents working at   organizations that employ a CISO (or equal position) believe that their CISO does not have an adequate level of  participation with executive management or the board of directors.
Despite the continuous cycle of cyber-threats and data breaches, some organizations continue  to treat cybersecurity as a necessary evil or compliance mandate alone.
•  Most organizations experience security incidents for a number of reasons.
The majority of organizations have   experienced one or several security incidents over the past two years.
There are many contributing factors to these  incidents, including a lack of training, a sub-optimally sized cybersecurity staff, and business management that treats  cybersecurity as a low priority.
Security incidents tend to result in lost productivity or even disruption of a critical  business service.
•  The majority of organizations are vulnerable to a damaging cyber-attack.
Ninety-one percent of survey respondents   believe that most organizations are extremely vulnerable or somewhat vulnerable to a damaging cyber-attack.
This is  a frightening data point since these ISSA professionals have direct and hands-on knowledge of their organizations’  cybersecurity status.
•  Organizations face numerous cybersecurity challenges.
When asked to identify their organizations’ top security   challenges, survey respondents pointed to a sub-optimal cybersecurity staff, too many manual cybersecurity  processes, and business managers’ lack of cybersecurity knowledge.
The data points to the reality that most  organizations have a wide range of cybersecurity challenges to address.
•  The cybersecurity skills shortage impact is widespread.
Seventy percent of survey respondents say that the   cybersecurity skills shortage has had an impact on their organization.
This impact includes an increasing workload for  the cybersecurity staff, the need to recruit junior employees in lieu of more experienced cybersecurity professionals,  and the need to focus on high-priority security events rather than security planning, strategy, or training.
When asked   © 2017 by The Enterprise Strategy Group, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals   7         to identify acute areas of cybersecurity skills shortages, respondents identified security analysts, application security  specialists, and cloud security experts.
•  ISSA members have suggestions to improve cybersecurity.
When asked what would be most beneficial for their  organizations’ overall cybersecurity, survey respondents suggested adding cybersecurity goals and metrics for  business and IT managers, documenting and formalizing cybersecurity processes, and hiring additional staff.
This data  points to an overall desire to make cybersecurity a more structured and critical component of the overall  organizational mission.

Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals   16         Cybersecurity Certifications   As stated in Figure 15, 61% of ISSA members surveyed for this report believe that cybersecurity certifications are far more  useful for getting a job than they are for doing a job.
Cybersecurity professionals invest in CISSP certification as part  of their career development.
This appears to be a good investment as it helps them get a job and move forward with a  cybersecurity career.
For example, a  cybersecurity professional with a CISSP may decide to pursue training in ethical hacking and then conclude this training by  passing a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) test.
Given the number of certifications and the constant drumbeat of certification marketing, cybersecurity professionals may  be tempted to fill their cards with acronyms as they achieve numerous security certifications.
Cybersecurity professionals would be best served by gaining CISSPs and then using other KSA  outlets to advance their skill sets and careers.

Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals   18         Cybersecurity Jobs   As described above, individuals become cybersecurity professionals to build upon their IT knowledge, satisfy their technical  curiosity, and take a stance against cyber-adversaries.
What do they look for when they join the cybersecurity ranks?
Leading financial compensation is important, but cybersecurity pros also look for financial incentives for training and career  development, an organization with a commitment to strong cybersecurity, and the ability to work with a highly skilled and  talented cybersecurity staff (see Figure 12).
(Percent   of respondents, N=343, three responses accepted)  Competitive or industry leading financial compensation  Organization provides support and financial incentives enabling cybersecurity staff to advance their careers  Business management’s commitment to strong   cybersecurity  The ability to work with a highly-skilled and talented  cybersecurity staff  Organization provides opportunities for career  advancements and promotions  Strong leadership from the CISO and other security  managers  The ability to work with the latest types of IT and/or  cybersecurity technologies  42%  38%  37%  34%  30%  24%  24%  The ability to learn business processes and work closely  with business units  Clear, concise, and consistent job descriptions and  responsibilities that are agreed upon by business, IT, and  security management  16%  15%  Organization has a mentoring program where an employee  can learn from more experienced peers  9%    Source: Enterprise Strategy Group and ISSA, 2017   While many cybersecurity professionals remain enthusiastic about their career choice, they may not be as bullish about  their current jobs.
Based upon this data, it’s safe to assume that most cybersecurity professional jobs lack some of the positive attributes  described above.
In other words, cybersecurity professionals are not receiving adequate incentives for career   © 2017 by The Enterprise Strategy Group, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals   19         development, business management does not have an appropriate commitment to cybersecurity, and cybersecurity  professionals are not given ample opportunities to work with other highly skilled cybersecurity professionals.
Smart CISOs will survey the cybersecurity staff to gauge their level of job satisfaction and strive for continuous  improvement in these and other areas.
(Percent of respondents, N=343)  Not at all satisfied, 4%  Not very satisfied, 8%  Somewhat satisfied,   48%  Very satisfied, 40%  As previously discussed, cybersecurity career professionals depend upon a regimen of continuous training for three  reasons:   1.
To align their skill sets with a constantly changing threat landscape   Source: Enterprise Strategy Group and ISSA, 2017      2.
To develop their careers   3.
To maintain job satisfaction   As previously described, skills development is also a critical component of overall job satisfaction.
Unfortunately, many organizations are not keeping up with an adequate level of cybersecurity training.
More than one- third (35%) of ISSA members surveyed claim that their organizations should provide a bit more cybersecurity training while  27% believe their organizations should provide significantly more training (see Figure 14).
Alarmingly, this data indicates that 62% of organizations are not providing the proper amount of training to keep up with  business and IT risks.
This should set off “red flags” for CEOs and corporate boards tasked with managing overall risk.
Executives should assess whether their organizations fall into this category and then adjust their training investments and  risk management strategies accordingly.

Training Provided to Keep Up with Business and IT Risk   In your opinion, does your current employer provide the cybersecurity team with the right   level of training in order for them to keep up with business and IT risk?
(Percent of   respondents, N=343)  No, my organization   should provide   significantly more   training so the   cybersecurity team can  keep up with business   and IT risk, 27%  No, my organization  should provide a bit  more training so the   cybersecurity team can  keep up with business   and IT risk, 35%  Yes, 38%  Source: Enterprise Strategy Group and ISSA, 2017      Survey respondents were presented with many statements and asked whether they agreed or disagreed with each (see  Figure 15).
This data provides some strong opinions on the state of cybersecurity professional careers.
For example:   •  96% of survey respondents strongly agree or agree that cybersecurity professionals must keep up with their skills or   their organizations face a significant disadvantage against cyber-adversaries.
In other words, continuous staff training  is a requirement for effective cyber-risk management.
•  85% of survey respondents strongly agree or agree that they are happy being cybersecurity professionals.
This   demonstrates their dedication and commitment to their role as network defenders.
•  73% of survey respondents strongly agree or agree that new types of security automation technologies will have a  positive impact on cybersecurity workload and career development.
This optimism is noteworthy as it represents a  technical solution to help address the global cybersecurity skills shortage.
•  68% of survey respondents strongly agree or agree that a cybersecurity career can be taxing on the balance between   one’s professional and personal life.
•  67% of survey respondents strongly agree or agree that while they try to keep up with their cybersecurity skills, it is   hard to do so given their job’s demands.
This data point is troubling because 96% of cybersecurity professionals agree  that keeping up with skills development is an essential countermeasure for addressing the evolving threat landscape.

•  An inadequately sized security team.
This data point is consistent with the global cybersecurity skills shortage   impacting organizations of all sizes and across all industries.
CISOs should assess skills and staffing gaps and look for  services partners who can augment cybersecurity staff.
•  The fact that business and executive management tend to treat cybersecurity as a low priority.

Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals   32         The Cybersecurity Skills Shortage   As in 2016, ESG and ISSA wanted to understand how the global cybersecurity skills shortage is impacting organizations.
The  short answer is that the impact is widespread, as 27% of cybersecurity professionals say that the cybersecurity skills  shortage has had a significant impact on their organizations, while 43% claim that their organizations have been impacted  somewhat by the global cybersecurity skills shortage (see Figure 28).
Level of Impact of Cybersecurity Skills Shortage   There has been a lot written about the global cybersecurity skills shortage.

Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals   35         This has led to a chaotic cybersecurity job market highlighted by salary inflation and aggressive recruiting tactics.
Nearly  half (49%) of survey respondents are actively solicited to consider other cybersecurity jobs at least once per week (see  Figure 31).
This rate is in line with last year’s, results where 46% of cybersecurity professionals were recruited at least once  per week.

Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals   36         Cybersecurity Improvement   Finally, cybersecurity professionals were asked to identify the most beneficial cybersecurity actions their organizations  could take in the future.
As seen in Figure 32, the most commonly identified actions include adding cybersecurity goals and  metrics to IT and business managers (43%), documenting and formalizing all cybersecurity processes (41%), and hiring  more cybersecurity professionals (38%).
In addition to highlighting the need to get the business and IT more involved and  accountable for cybersecurity performance, respondents believe that security inefficiencies must be addressed through  more formal and documented processes.
And while hiring more employees could help the ongoing cybersecurity skills  shortage, solutions like technology automation, SaaS offerings, and managed security services could serve as alternatives.
Actions That Would Provide the Most Cybersecurity Benefits to Organization   Which of the following actions would provide the most cybersecurity benefits for your organization   moving forward?
(Percent of respondents, N=343, multiple responses accepted)  Add cybersecurity goals and metrics to IT and business managers  Document and formalize all cybersecurity processes  Hire more cybersecurity professionals  Increase cybersecurity budgets  Provide more cybersecurity training to non-technical employees  Ensure cybersecurity and IT departments have the right tools and  compensation to work more collaboratively on common goals  Provide more cybersecurity training to the IT team  Provide more cybersecurity training to the cybersecurity team  Include security oversight and testing in the application  development process  Replace legacy cybersecurity technologies with modern  alternatives  Increase the amount of CISOs participation with executive  management and the board of directors  Change the reporting structure for the CISO  Increase the use of professional and or managed security services  43%  41%  38%  37%  36%  36%  35%  34%  32%  26%  22%  17%  15%     Source: Enterprise Strategy Group and ISSA, 2017   © 2017 by The Enterprise Strategy Group, Inc.

Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals   37         Conclusion   The ESG/ISSA report reveals several pervasive issues:   1.
Many cybersecurity professionals are not managing their careers well.
The majority of cybersecurity professionals aren’t receiving the right level of skills development to address the   rapidly evolving threat landscape.
This leads to a steady increase in cyber-risk at their organizations.
Cybersecurity professionals are in high demand leading to a cycle of perpetual recruitment, high levels of attrition,   and salary inflation.
The cybersecurity skills shortage is impacting the majority of organizations and placing an undue burden on   existing infosec staff.
Too many organizations still treat security as a necessary evil rather than as part of business processes and culture.
Implications for Cybersecurity Professionals   Just as they did in 2016, cybersecurity professionals should use the research presented in this report as guidance for career  planning.
This is especially true for those in the early stages of a cybersecurity career or individuals seeking to enter the  field.
The data indicates that cybersecurity professionals should:   •  Invest more time in career development.
The report reveals that most cybersecurity professionals don’t have a well-  defined career path and plan to get to the next level.
ESG/ISSA believe that cybersecurity professionals should invest  time in career development and planning at all stages of their career lifecycles.
This is especially true for junior  cybersecurity professionals who have the opportunity to take their careers into emerging technical areas (i.e., cloud  security, IoT security, etc.)
or focus on business aspects of cybersecurity (i.e., risk management, CISO positions, etc.).
Cybersecurity professionals should take the time to explore career possibilities, research appealing options, and map  out a career progression to achieve their goals over time.
•  Look to training and peers rather than security certifications to improve cybersecurity KSAs.
Cybersecurity professionals   should join professional organizations/user groups, attend industry events, and take specific hands-on training  courses to maximize networking opportunities that can help them improve the skills they need for day-to-day  excellence and long-term career development.
•  Develop business skills throughout your careers.
The research presented in this report reveals that many cybersecurity   professionals tend to have limited understanding of the business aspects of cybersecurity.
To increase career  development, ambitious cybersecurity professionals should focus on business processes and objectives and then align  them with risk management, cybersecurity controls, and continuous monitoring.
Given the global skills shortage, underappreciated, bored, and   overwhelmed cybersecurity professionals should take their skills elsewhere.
Look for organizations that provide  training incentives, career development services, and mentoring programs to maximize the potential for job  satisfaction.
•  Anticipate and plan for a cybersecurity skills shortage.
The ESG/ISSA data suggest that the majority of organizations will  feel the impact of the cybersecurity skills shortage in one way or another.
Therefore, cybersecurity professionals must  assume that they will be short on people and skills.
Smart infosec pros will plan for this reality with compensating   © 2017 by The Enterprise Strategy Group, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals   38         controls such as an increasing dependence on managed/professional services, process automation, and more use of  advanced analytics technologies.
Research Implications for Employers   All organizations face competition to attract and retain cybersecurity talent.
To recruit and retain the best cybersecurity  talent, organizations should:   •  Recruit cybersecurity professionals from IT and beyond.
Most cybersecurity professionals start their cybersecurity   careers in IT.
With no end in sight for the global cybersecurity skill shortage, CISOs should create aggressive programs  for recruiting IT talent interested in cybersecurity opportunities.
Based upon the report data, it may be worthwhile to  target candidates who’ve worked with multiple technologies, those with IT operations and networking technology  experience, and those with a background of collaborating with business managers on IT initiatives.
These IT administrators would make ideal  candidates for cybersecurity.
These individuals could help bridge the business/cybersecurity gap that exists in many  organizations today.
•  Invest more in cybersecurity training.
Advancing the KSAs of the existing cybersecurity team and new recruits demands   a commitment toward continuing education and training.
Investing in leading cybersecurity training can improve the  effectiveness of the current cybersecurity staff and lower overall risk to the business.
•  Provide career development advice and services.
CISOs should adopt programs and support services to help   cybersecurity team members develop their careers.
This should include mentoring programs as well as encouraging  the cybersecurity team to participate in professional organizations.
This effort will help improve the cybersecurity  team’s job satisfaction and longevity.
•  Assess job satisfaction within the cybersecurity department.
CISOs should survey the cybersecurity staff to assess job  satisfaction levels and areas for improvement.
If the organization has a strong commitment to cybersecurity, CISOs  should be able to fine-tune problem areas like improving training and career development.
Most organizations admit to at least one security incident over the past   few years, though the numbers are likely a lot higher.
In truth, organizations should expect to experience security  compromises on an ongoing basis.
This means that organizations need formal processes for incident response.
Furthermore, these plans should extend beyond the IT domain to include business executives, legal counsel, HR  managers, etc.
•  Take the cybersecurity skills shortage into account as part of every initiative and decision.
The ESG/ISSA report   reinforces previous data detailing the global cybersecurity skills shortage.
It is now clear that CISOs should assume a  cybersecurity personnel and skills deficit in each decision they make.
For example, CISOs should:   o  Emphasize ease of use for all security technology purchases.
o   Initiate and push projects for security automation and orchestration that use technology to alleviate  tedious manual processes.
o   Investigate, test, and deploy technologies offering advanced analytics technologies.
o  Find use cases for managed security services.

Cyber Security Education, Qualifications and Training     Prof. Keith M. Martin Information Security Group, Royal Holloway, University of London, Egham, Surrey  TW20 0EX, UK      This paper is a postprint of a paper submitted to and accepted for publication in the IET  Engineering & Technology Reference and is subject to Institution of Engineering and  Technology Copyright.
The copy of record is available at IET Digital Library   Official version, 1st published in June 2015, doi: 10.1049/etr.2014.0029, ISSN 2056-4007,  www.ietdl.org      Abstract    The rise in significance of cyber security has led to an increase in the range of interesting career  paths that can be followed in this area.
Inevitably there has also been an explosion in the  diversity of available cyber security education, qualifications and training, most of which is  targeted at those seeking to engage with this promising job market.
In this article, some  guidelines are provided on how to select appropriate education, qualifications and training in  cyber security, alongside a review of some of the many current offerings and how to differentiate  between them.
While the focus is on the UK cyber security sector, many of the observations  have wider relevance.
Introduction    The cyber security profession is growing and there are an increasing number of fascinating ways  of making a career in cyber security.
As organisations have embraced the many benefits of  moving their infrastructures and businesses online, there has been growing awareness of the  need to manage the cyber security risks that arise.
Recent years have seen both an increase in  the need for general organisations employ their own cyber security specialists, as well as an  expansion of the cyber security service provision sector [1].
A 2014 UK Government report [2] presented the findings of an exercise to determine the needs  of business with respect to cyber security skills.
It highlighted ‘a demand amongst businesses for  more professionals with a range of technical skills, but also a demand for new entrants with  stronger business skills and greater work experience’.
It also identified ‘the importance of  increasing cyber skills among those who create, purchase and use technology to reduce  business vulnerability to cyber attack, and among company decision makers who are responsible  for managing business risks’.
Although it has been possible to follow a career in cyber security outside of government for  several decades, the current rapid expansion of the industry has taken place ahead of any  mature notion of professionalization in the industry.
The ‘UK Cyber Security Strategy’ [3] has  helped to consolidate and galvanise attempts to develop a stronger notion of what it means to be  a cyber-security professional and to identify different cyber security roles.
A career in cyber security naturally requires relevant skills and competence.
One of the challenges for anyone seeking to prepare themselves for entering, or  developing, a cyber-security career is which of those to pursue.
Note that throughout this article no attempt is made to distinguish between the terms ‘cyber  security’ (a relatively recent nomenclature) and the more established terms ‘information security’  and ‘information assurance’.
After a short discussion on identifying needs, this article will, in turn, examine cyber security  education, qualifications and training from academia, professional bodies and the commercial  sector.
Identifying Needs    The first step towards identifying how to upskill in cyber security is to identify needs.
In terms of  cybersecurity careers, here are some issues worth considering in advance of researching  education or training in this area:    ?
Upskilling programmes offer a range of qualifications, including academic degrees  and professional certifications.
It is worth identifying the resources required to complete an upskilling  programme.
Some programmes   require a block of time away from work, others require a longer commitment of less time (day  release), while others can be conducted remotely (distance or online learning).
A good upskilling programme should make it clear what prerequisite   knowledge is required.
Some programmes assume some existing cyber security expertise,  while others may be entry level.
It is  important to identify what is required and how closely an offering matches this.
It is worth considering whether a particular cyber security   career role is being sought, such as Chief Information Security Officer, or whether focused  subject expertise is wanted, such as for penetration testing.
It may be important to identify the extent to which upskilling needs relate   to acquiring the ‘knowledge of how to do something’, as opposed to acquiring an ability to  ‘demonstrate that a particular skill has been applied in practice to a certain competency  level’.
There are some differences between the requirements for   certain government and private sector career options.
Technology specificity.
Some upskilling programmes relate directly to specific technologies or   are at least biased towards them.
Incident Management,   Information Systems Research.
Information security management,  Information risk management,  Implementing secure systems,  Information Assurance Methodologies and Testing,     Institute of Information Security Professionals (IISP) Skills Framework    Although it was noted that there was no mature framework for identifying relevant skills for a  career in cyber security, in 2010 the IISP [4] established the IISP Information Security Skills  Framework [5].
This identifies ‘a range of competencies expected of  Information Security and Information Assurance Professionals in the effective performance of  their roles’ and was developed through collaboration between established professionals in the  public and private sectors, as well as academia.
In many senses this is the best cyber security  benchmarking framework that exists (certainly in the UK).
The IISP Skills Framework is based around the following competency areas, noting that not all  roles require expertise in all categories:    ?
Operational Security Management,  ?
Business Continuity Management,  ?
The UK  has a ‘National Cyber Security Programme’, which is intended to implement the UK Cyber  Security Strategy.
This includes a mission to develop knowledge, capability and skills in cyber  security, much of which is developed through CESG, the UK National Technical Authority for  cyber security and the more public-facing part of GCHQ.
As part of this initiative the ‘CESG  Certified Training (CCT) Scheme’ [6] is attempting to assure high quality cyber security upskilling  programmes by certifying specific programmes against the IISP Skills Framework.
Likewise, a  variation of the IISP Skills Framework is being used to benchmark ‘GCHQ Certified Master’s  degree programmes in cyber security’ [7].
Education against Training    Much has been written about the general differences between ‘education’ and ‘training’ and most  remarks about this apply as well to cyber security as to other disciplines (e.g.
Crudely speaking, education is more focused on the acquisition of knowledge and  understanding, through which skills are developed.
There is a strong case  for engaging in both education and training as part of career development in cyber security.
Consider the case of someone tasked with taking on  a new role overseeing the management of cryptographic keys for an organisation.
A decent education programme in the area of key management should equip the employee with  a sound understanding of the principles behind cryptography, its functionality and limitations, the  significance of key management, an understanding of key lifecycles, an overview of hardware  security modules (HSMs) and so on.
This education should give the employee a very clear  understanding of the role that key management plays within the wider cyber security strategy of  any organisation.
What an education programme is unlikely to provide is hands-on experience of,  for example, managing keys using the specific HSM technology deployed by the organisation.
Indeed, it is probably unlikely to have given the employee hand-on experience of using any HSM  technology.
These are more likely to offer hands-on  experience and, in many cases, deal with very specific technologies.
They might also learn how to develop policies and procedures for governing keys  within the organisation and so on.
A new employee might require both.
A new graduate with an education in cryptography  might require training.
An experienced key manager from another organisation might require  training on the specific systems in use.
And an existing employee with some  hand-on experience might well require education in order to better understand the role and  prepare to take on more responsibilities.
Once you understand the fundamentals of key management you are well  equipped to tackle future.
developments.
In  cyber security, as in other fields, education and training complement one another very  comfortably.
Progression in the cyber security profession can be aided by prudent engagement  in both activities.
Academic Qualifications    A large number of upskilling programmes in cyber security are provided by academic institutions.
This has particularly been so since the establishment of the UK National Cyber Security  Programme, which has incentivised academic institutions to engage in cyber security activities.
Why study an academic cyber security programme?
Certification of Institutions and Programmes    Owing to the relative explosion in the number of cyber security degree programmes, the UK  Government is currently engaging in a set of certification activities designed to identify academic  institutions and programmes that meet a number of quality benchmarks.
Academic Centres of Excellence in Cyber Security Research [9].
This status has been   awarded to institutions which are engaged in world class research in cyber security.
Acquisition of Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research (ACE-CSR) status  requires not just quality in research, but also established pedigree over a span of time and  critical mass of research activity.
Certified Master’s degrees in Cyber Security [7].
The first set of  certified Master’s degrees was for programmes that provide a general education in cyber  security.
Academic Centres of Excellence in Cyber Security Education.
Choosing an academic programme    There are many different academic cyber security upskilling programmes on the market.
For  another perspective on selecting academic programmes in cyber security see [10].
Cyber security focus.
It is worth carefully checking the syllabus of degree programmes with   ‘security’ in their titles, since many academic institutions offer flavours  of more general degrees that may qualify for a ‘security’ label with only a small security  component.
A  healthy diversity of teaching staff with cyber security interests is a good measure of this.
The depth and breadth of external (industrial, government and other)   connections are a good measure of programme reputational quality.
Cyber security is a  practical discipline and a good programme should be embedded in the wider cyber security  community.
Engagement in quality cyber security research suggests a strong   environment within which to receive cyber security upskilling.
All academic programmes require substantial time commitments and many   require fulltime study.
Research degrees    Research degrees require the most specialised ability and greatest time commitment.
They have  high entry requirements and are targeted at anyone considering a career where research skills  are required.
The standard research degree is the 3-year PhD programme.
All ACE-CSR  institutions are required to have an established and active PhD programme in place.
The UK  National Cyber Security Programme has funded two Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs) in  Cyber Security (at University of Oxford [11] and Royal Holloway, University of London [12]).
These CDTs provide an additional first year of cohort-based structured taught cyber security  training in advance of the 3-year research component.
Master’s degrees    By far the most popular type of dedicated degree programme in cyber security is a Master’s,  which is typically 1-year fulltime or 2-year part-time.
Many of these programmes are well- established and have a strong track record of preparing students for cyber security careers [13].
Relatively few Master’s degree programmes provide a general balanced coverage of cyber  security backed up by a strong delivery environment.
The Certified Master’s degree in Cyber  Security initiative [7] has thus far identified just four fully-certified programmes (at Edinburgh  Napier University, Lancaster University, University of Oxford, and Royal Holloway, University  of London).
A number of Master’s programmes focus on specialised aspects of cyber security.
Examples of specialist  programmes include Digital Forensics (Cranfield University), Cybercrime (University of Derby)  and Security Management (City University), but there are many more.
It is worth noting that a small number of Master’s programmes can be conducted by distance  learning and hence fitted around work commitments.
Examples include Edinburgh Napier and  Royal Holloway, University of London.
Undergraduate degrees    There are a number of 3-year undergraduate degree programmes in topics relating to cyber  security.
It is at least contestable whether degrees at this level dedicated to cyber security make  complete sense, since cyber security is perhaps best understood within a wider context.
Perhaps  the most critical features of such programmes to consider are whether they offer balanced  coverage of cyber security and whether they provide the broad range of transferable skills  expected from a more traditional undergraduate degree programme.
An example of a  programme that appears to offer these strengths is the BSc Computer and Information Security  at Plymouth University.
Perhaps undergraduate programmes are more prevalent in more traditional disciplines that offer  a component of cyber security specialisation.
While all modern programmes in areas such as  computer science should include coverage of some cyber security, some programmes offer more  substantive coverage.
In the absence of any formal certification of such programmes, broader  institutional activity in cyber security is a useful indicator of quality of cyber security coverage.
Diplomas and certificates    Some academic institutions offer certificates or diplomas in cyber security related topics.
Open online courses    A number of platforms offer free university courses in cyber security.
These are typically short  taster courses that can be studied free over the Internet.
Examples include:    ?
This is arguably the leading open learning platform and offers a small range of   free cyber security courses from partner institutions around the world, including Stanford,  University of Maryland University of London.
In particular, it hosts an ‘Introduction to  Cyber Security’, which was developed by the Open University as part of the UK national  Cyber Security Programme.
A range of educational audio and video podcasts on cyber security topics,  including lectures and interviews, are available from institutional sites hosted by iTunes U.
Professional Qualifications    Another major source of cyber security upskilling programmes relate to qualifications provided by  professional bodies.
Professional qualifications tend to assess both the knowledge and the ability  to put knowledge into practice, with many qualifications targeted at very specific professional  roles.
Since these are in many ways complementary to, academic  programmes it is common for cyber security professionals to hold several professional  qualifications as well as an academic degree.
Some of the main professional bodies issuing  qualifications in cyber security are as follows.
There  are a number of Special Interest Groups for aspiring cyber security professionals.
The BCS  provides development opportunities at a broad range of career levels through events and  qualifications.
CESG    The CCP scheme [17] is the UK Government’s approved standard for assessing cyber security  professionals.
The CCP scheme covers seven formally defined roles in cyber security and  assesses them to four different skill levels.
These roles are security and information risk advisor,  information assurance architect, accreditor, information assurance auditor, IT security officer,  communications and security officer, and penetration tester.
Applicants for CCP certification can  be independently assessed by one of three separate approved certification bodies (APM Group,  BCS and IISP/CREST/Royal Holloway).
CESG also operates the ‘CESG Listed Advisor’ scheme [18] which identifies and support  consultants who provide information security advice to central government.
CREST    ‘CREST’ [19] is an example of a professional body focused around one type of career within  cyber security, namely ethical hacking and allied capabilities in the commercial sector.
IISP    The IISP [4] was established in 2006 to provide a professional body focused on supporting cyber  security professionals.
While it does not itself directly provide qualifications, it is highly influential  in the cyber security upskilling space as it established the IISP Skills Framework [3] and supports  CCP certification.
ISACA    ‘ISACA’ [20] is a US-based international membership and certification organisation which has  been in operation for over 40 years.
The focus of ISACA is audit and control of Information Systems.
ISACA provides a  range of services to aspiring professionals, including several relevant certification programmes in  the area of cyber security:    ?
Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA).
The CISA certification is globally recognised   and is probably the most important benchmarking certificate for cyber security professionals  involved in auditing and monitoring information systems.
Certified Information Security Manager (CISM).
The CISM certification is focused on security   management and widely recognised as a respected assessment of capability to oversee an  enterprise’s information security.
Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC).
The CRISC certification   assesses capability in risk management, including risk assessment, response and  monitoring.
International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium (ISC2)    The ISC2 [21] is a US-based international certification body which has been operating for over 20  years.
By far the most influential of the ISC2 certifications is the ‘Certified Information Systems Security  Professional’ (CISSP).
Indeed CISSP has become something of a global benchmark qualification  in cyber security.
CISSP certification requires passing an examination across ten domains of  knowledge.
It also requires evidence of at least 5 years of relevant work experience, although 1  year of credit is given for possessing certain academic qualifications (including a Master’s degree  in Information Security).
Evidence of continued professional development is required to remain  ‘in good standing’, otherwise the examination must be retaken every 3 years.
CISSP holders can  achieve further specialised certification in security architecture, security engineering and security  management.
Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional.
Systems Security Certified Practitioner.
Certified Cyber Forensics Professional.
HealthCare Information Security and Privacy Practitioner.
Commercial Qualifications      A third source of cyber security upskilling programmes is the private sector.
The SANS Institute    The ‘SANS Institute’ [22] merits special mention as it is one of the most significant suppliers of  commercial training in cyber security.
The SANS Institute is a private US company founded in  1989 and has gained an impressive reputation for the range and  scale of its training activities in cyber security.
Many SANS courses are focused on specific  security operations activities.
There are more generic or foundation courses along with courses  which highlight security aspects of other disciplines such as programming/ developing systems.
SANS courses are available in a number of different delivery modes,  including distance learning.
SANS runs the ‘Global Information Assurance Certification’ scheme which certifies   information security professionals in both technical and practical aspects of cyber security.
SANS operates the ‘SANS Technology Institute’, which is a private institution issuing   Master’s degrees (in information security management and information security engineering)  and certificate programmes.
However,  cyber security technologies are often complex and it is entirely appropriate that a number of  vendors offer cyber security upskilling programmes based on their specific technologies.
One well-known example of a vendor providing its own security certifications is Cisco.
Security- related certification provided by Cisco [23] include (among others):    ?
Cisco Certified Network Associate Security, which validates the ability to set up a basic   security network infrastructure, including core security technologies and monitoring.
Cisco Certified Network Professional Security, which validates the skills to be a network   security engineer, including maintenance and deployment of appropriate tools for routing,  switching and security defence.
CESG Certified Training    As previously mentioned, one of the initiatives that forms part of the UK National Cyber Security  Programme is the development of the CCT scheme [6].
The CCT scheme is intended to identify  high standard cyber security training amidst the plethora of offerings on the market.
An upskilling  programme needs to have been rigorously assessed in terms of its content, trainers and ability to  manage training events in order to qualify for CCT status.
Other Professional Development Activities    There are many other initiatives in the areas of cyber security training that do not fall neatly into  the previous categories.
The ‘Cyber Security Apprenticeship scheme’ is being run by the Tech Partnership [24] and  provides on-the job training as well as some classroom-based training.
This scheme is intended  to accelerate new entrants into the cyber security profession by giving them real experience of  working in the cyber security sector.
The Tech Partnership is also supporting the development of  ‘Cyber Academy Learning Pathways’, which are intended to align with the IISP Skills Framework  and provide assistance for individuals planning career progression in cyber security.
The ‘Cyber Security Challenge’ [25] is an innovative series of national competitions designed to  inspire people to enter the cyber security profession.
While not directly a training activity, the  Cyber Security Challenge does identify and inspire individuals to progress their cyber security  skills, both as participants and as challenge setters.
The Challenge also supports a cyber- security mentoring scheme.
There are a number of initiatives designed to support cyber security in specific sectors or  targeting particular audiences.
One example of the latter is ‘Responsible for Information’ [26],  which is a free online course that has been developed by the UK Government for small and  medium-sized enterprises to provide basic information security training.
Conclusion    There probably has never been a more interesting time to consider a career in cyber security.
However, cyber security is both multi-faceted and constantly evolving, making it challenging to  acquire and maintain the skills necessary to act as a responsible cyber security professional.
Anyone aspiring to enter the cyber security profession would be wise to engage in some level of  education and training, and perhaps seek to acquire suitable qualifications.
Indeed, most people  already employed as cyber security professionals regularly require upskilling.
This article has  reviewed a range of available options for cyber security education, qualifications and training.
It is hoped that these  observations are of some assistance in charting a successful and rewarding career in the cyber  security profession.

Just  as  cybersecurity  professionals  must  hone their  skills  continually  to  keep  up  with  a  constantly  shifting  threat  landscape,  cybersecurity  programs  need  to  evolve  to  ensure  they  continue  to produce  knowledgeable  graduates.
In this  regard, professional certifications in the cybersecurity industry offer an opportunity for IHLs to maintain a current curriculum.
Governing  bodies  that  manage  professional  certifications  are  highly  motivated  to  ensure  their  certifications  maintain  their  currency in the competitive marketplace.
Moreover, employers who hire security professionals look for certifications in assessing  a  candidate’s  overall  credentials.
This  paper  attempts  to  fill  a  void  in  the  literature  by  exploring  the  use  of  professional  certifications as helpful input to shaping and maintaining a cybersecurity curriculum.
To this end, we offer a literature analysis  that  shows  how  changes  made  to  professional  certifications  are  applicable  and  relevant  to  maintaining  a  cybersecurity  curriculum.
We  then  provide  a  case  study  involving  an  undergraduate  cybersecurity  program  in a  mid-sized  university  in  the  United  States.
Before  concluding,  we  discuss  topics  such  as  experiential  learning,  cybersecurity  capstone  courses,  and  the  limitations to our approach.

NSA/DHS Centers of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense  (and  Operations)  (CAE-CD,  CAE-CO),  NICE  Cybersecurity  Workforce  Framework  (NCWF),  ACM  Joint  Task  Force  on  Cybersecurity Education).
Yet, a research gap exists regarding  how  to  maintain  and  update  cybersecurity  curricula  at  a  practical  level.
Journal of Information Systems Education, Vol.
28(2) December 2017101While  many  disciplines  evolve  over  time,  cybersecurity  faces a constantly shifting landscape of threats, vulnerabilities,  and  countermeasures  that  can  impact  curricula.
Just  as  cybersecurity  professionals  must  engage  in  continuous  education  to  ensure  they  remain  current  in  their  skill  sets,  IHLs  with  cybersecurity  programs  must  also  be  prepared  to  continuously  evaluate  their  curriculum  to  provide  students  with  the  most  current  and  relevant  knowledge  to  succeed  in  this field.
required   that  are   There  is  certainly  no  shortage  of  new  and  emerging  sources  for  faculty  members  to  reference  when  organizing  their curricula.
Frameworks  such  as  NCWF  provide  a  detailed  listing  of  knowledge,  skills,  and  abilities  to  successfully  perform  various  work  tasks  in  a  cybersecurity  career  (NIST,  2016).
However,  simply  incorporating  the  minimum  baseline requirements or objectives from such frameworks can  limit  an  IHL’s  ability  to  fully  differentiate  itself  from  other  IHLs  offering  similar  cybersecurity  degrees.
Cybersecurity  programs can therefore plan their curriculum initially around  such  well-accepted  the  ongoing  maintenance and improvement of a program can be bolstered  by considering professional certifications in the cybersecurity  field.
frameworks;  however,   Any successful cybersecurity program should consider the  needs  of  the  workforce  in  designing  and  maintaining  its  curriculum.
A  common  job  title  for  recent  graduates  with  a  cybersecurity degree is the Information Security Analyst.
The  Department  of  Labor  describes  an  Information  Security  Analyst as a person that may     plan,  implement,  upgrade,  or  monitor  security  measures for the protection of computer networks and  information;  ensure  appropriate  security  controls  are  in  place  that  will  safeguard  digital  files  and  vital  electronic infrastructure; respond to computer security  breaches  and  viruses  (Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics,  2010).
the     Information  Security  Analyst  jobs  are  expected  to  grow  by  18%, and many organizations prefer candidates to have some  sort of cybersecurity certification (Bureau of Labor Statistics,  2015a,  2015b).
As  such,  there  are  over  140  professional  certifications from 30 certifying organizations that are relevant  to  job  description  (Department of Labor, 2016).
Information  Security  Analyst   Considering  the  preference  given  to  job  candidates  with  certifications and the number of certifications available, many  argue  that  it  is  in  the  students’  best  interest  to  pursue  professional  certification  (McGill  and  Dixon,  2005;  Rob,  2014;  Wireschen  and  Zhang,  2010).
There are hundreds of cybersecurity-related certifications, and  navigating  through  the  confusing  array  can  be  a  daunting  challenge.”    Moreover,  earning a  professional  certification is  highly  useful  for  promotion  in  the  cybersecurity  career  field  (Wright,  2015).
If  certifications  are  so  valuable  in  the   incorporating   technology  (IT)   for  certification  exams  by   workforce,  then  it  would  be  prudent  for  IHLs  to  prepare  students  the  objectives of those exams into the overall program curriculum.
In 2016, there were  more than 200,000 cybersecurity job  postings, and some  forecast this number to grow to over 1.5  million  globally  by  2019  (Tittel,  2016).
Cybersecurity  positions  are  more  likely  to  require  certifications  than  other  information  jobs.
One-third  (35%)  of  cybersecurity jobs call for an industry certification, compared  to  23%  of  IT  jobs  overall  (Burning  Glass,  2015).
The following  question was given: “How important are industry certifications  to your firm’s hiring process?” They responded with a 3.9/5.0  average (1 = not important; 5 = very important) with 12 of the  18 (67%) stating it was either important (4) or very important  (5).
One respondent commented,     For an IT security position, we look for certifications  because there is a minimum level of knowledge we are  looking  is  nothing  wrong  with  certifications  –  they  can  only  help.
for...   there   Organizations  employing  information  security  professionals  generally  base  their  assessment  of  an  individual’s  skill  level  on three main assessment criteria.
These include 1) academic  qualifications leading to a diploma or a degree, 2) professional  and vendor-specific certifications, and 3) job experience, such  as  internships  or  full  employment  (Hentea,  Dhillon,  and  Manpreet,  2006).
Hentea,  Dhillon,  and  Manpreet  (2006)  stated,     Professional  and  vendor  certifications  in  information  security validate competencies and skills, but they are  not  replacing  experience  or  education.
Academic  programs exposing the students to theoretical concepts  and  problem  solving  experience  are  critical  for  preparing  graduates  for  jobs  in  the  information  security (emphasis added).
This same sentiment was conveyed by the respondent from the  authors’  informal  survey  noted  above.
Cybersecurity issues are  complex,  and  there  is  no  standard  recipe  for  protecting  informational  assets  within  organizations.
Therefore,  a  solid  base  of  content  knowledge  and  technical  skill  will  only  take  one  so  in  an  engaging  environment, challenging them to think about problems from  multiple  angles,  and  providing  a  broad  cybersecurity  education, IHLs are well-positioned to develop individuals to  succeed in the marketplace.
Upon graduation, students will be well-  in   Journal of Information Systems Education, Vol.
Further,  students  must  demonstrate  more  than  an  ability  to  memorize  facts  and  definitions,  often  required  to  pass  certification  exams  –  they  need  to  learn  how  to  reason  through  complex  problems  and  think  critically  about  issues  presented  to  them.
In  sum,  we  propose  an  approach  that  complements  other  cybersecurity  curriculum  frameworks.
Certifications  are  commonly  referenced  as  a  requirement  in  job  postings  and  have  existed  than  some  newly  developed  curriculum  frameworks.
Furthermore,  the  fact  that  so  many  highly  specialized  cybersecurity  certifications  exist  allows  IHLs to develop customized or specialized courses.
This can  provide  an  IHL  with  a  competitive  advantage  in  attracting  high-caliber  students,  especially  in  situations  where  local  organizations are looking for specialized cybersecurity talent.
Specialized courses may sit alongside the standard knowledge  courses  specified  in  many  educational  frameworks  of  this  field.
The  certification  marketplace  is  competitive,  and  governing  bodies  will  ensure  their  certifications  maintain  industry  relevancy  or  else  they  will  lose  value.
Next, we demonstrate with a case  study  how  one  IHL  is  using  this  approach  to  maintain  a  current cybersecurity undergraduate program.
LITERATURE ANALYSIS: FACTORS IMPACTING   CERTIFICATION RELEVANCY   to  assess   influencing   the  factors  or  forces   To maintain the relevancy of their exams, certification bodies  need  the  cybersecurity  field  and  then  update  their  exam  content  accordingly.
These factors may emanate from external forces  outside  the  boundaries  of  the  cybersecurity  field  or  internal  forces from within the field.
These are important  to IHLs because, fortunately, they are the same general factors  that impact the content of a cybersecurity curriculum.
While  the  authors  evaluated  several  certifying  bodies, we  focused on the International Information Systems  Security  Certification  Consortium  [(ISC)2]  considerations  for  maintaining  their  existing  certifications  and  introducing  new  ones.
This  organization  is  a  logical  choice  because  of  the  prominence  of  the  Certified  Information  System  Security  Professional  (CISSP)  credential.
Moreover,  (ISC)2  states  that   the  CISSP  was  the  first  certification  in  the  information  security  field  to  meet  the  requirements  of  ISO/IEC  Standard  17024,  which  requires  certifying  bodies  to  maintain  a  certification scheme for persons that includes the confirmation  and relevancy of exam content areas (ISO/IEC, 2012).2   their  exam  content:   Based on our literature analysis, we categorized five major  factors  that  cybersecurity  certifying  bodies  consider  in  the  maintenance  of  landscape,  technology changes, industry standards, workforce needs, and  government and regulation.
We  feel,  however,  justifies  why  certification curricula provide relevant and timely information  that should be incorporated into higher learning curricula.
The EC-Council with  its  Certified  Ethical  Hacker  (CEH)  exam  regularly  updates  exam  material  on  the  threat  landscape  to  include  the  latest  attack vectors, tools, and techniques that malicious hackers are  using  in  their  environment  (EC-Council,  2016).
(ISC)2  also  updated its CISSP and System Security Certified Professional  (SSCP)  domains  of  knowledge  in  2015  in  response  to  “changes  in  technology  and  the  evolving  threat  landscape  occurring  in  the  information  security  field”  ((ISC)2,  2015a).
These  updates  included  a  deeper  focus  on  asset  security  and  security  assessment  given  threat  landscape pertaining to these areas.
2.2 Technology Changes  Just  as  changes  to  the  threat  landscape  present  critical  challenges  to  the  field,  so  do  changes  and  evolutions  in  the  technology  itself  (Shearer,  2015).
Technology  advances,  which  toward  technological  progression,  never  stop.
For  example,  the  Internet of Things and cloud computing are two relatively new  technology  paradigms  that  are  having  major  impacts  on  the  cybersecurity field.
Such changes have ushered in updates to  many  current  certifications  but  also  the  introduction  of  new  ones,  such  as  the  Certified  Cloud  Security  Professional  (CCSP) credential in 2015 ((ISC)2, 2015b).
Demonstrating this  influence,  this  certification  was  developed  in  recognition  of  the  market  need  for  cloud  security  experts  in  response  to  changes  in  technology.
Another  such  example  is  the  Global  Information  Assurance  Certification  (GIAC)  offering  a  certification for Python coders.
This niche credential responds  to the need for penetration testers to rapidly develop their own  tools  rather  than  wait  for  someone  else  to  develop  it.
The  Python programming language is a technology well suited for  this task (GIAC, 2016b).
2.3 Industry Standards    Certifying organizations also respond to industry  forces such  as  standards  and  best  practices.
Over  the  past  decade,  numerous  industry  standards  and  guidelines  have  emerged  worldwide, such as ISO standards, NIST security frameworks,   inexhaustible  drive   society’s   to   Journal of Information Systems Education, Vol.
Similarly,   regularly  conducts  assessments  of   and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI- DSS).
The  ISO  27000-series  is  a  prominent  international  standard  providing  both  statements  on  information security management as well as procedures to be  adopted  by  organizations  to  ensure  information  security  (Backhouse,  Hsu,  and  Silva,  2006).
Numerous  NIST  standards,  such  as  publication  800-53,  were  originally  intended to serve U.S. Federal Government agencies but have  been  adopted  or  used  as  a  benchmark  for  designing  security  programs in private industry as well.
PCI-DSS was developed  by  the  major  credit  card  issuers  to  help  merchants  securely  process  card  payments  and  store  card-related  data.
Such  standards  are  updated  relevant.
As  such,  cybersecurity certifying bodies do not ignore their content and  include them in exams such as the CISSP (Stewart, Chapple,  and Gibson, 2015).
This is valuable information  used  in  their  certification  maintenance  process.
For  instance,  70%  of  survey  respondents  stated  they  thought  a  cloud  security certification is either very or somewhat relevant.
This  feedback  helped  to  justify  the  CCSP  as  well  as  introduce  additional  cloud  security  material  into  the  CISSP  Common  ISACA  Body  of  Knowledge  organization  tasks  performed  by  currently  certified  individuals.
The  Certified  Information System Auditor (CISA) content was restructured  to  reflect  the  latest  responsibilities  of  IS  audit  professionals  (ISACA,  2015).
ISACA  has  also  polled  cybersecurity  professionals  to  identify  key  skills  that  are  lacking  in  the  available  workforce.
Additionally,  CompTIA  updates  its  Security+  exam  using  input  from  subject-matter experts and industry-wide surveys to ensure its  exam  verifies  what an information security professional with  two years in the workforce must know (CompTIA, 2013).
2.5 Government and Regulation    Laws,  regulations,  and  governments  can  significantly  impact  the  cybersecurity  field  of  a  nation.
In  the  United  States,  organizations  like  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS) and the National Security Agency (NSA) significantly  influence  the  field;  their  impact  on  cybersecurity  education  will be discussed later in this paper.
For example, (ISC)2 tailored a  credential  to  suit  government  needs  in  Japan  ((ISC)2,  2009),  and  Information  Security  &  Privacy  Practitioner  (HCISPP)  credential  was  introduced  to  help  specialists  navigate  regulatory  environment.
The output  of these factors can help colleges and universities maintain a  relevant cybersecurity curriculum.
Factors   Threat  Landscape  Changing Technology  Workforce   Needs  Industry Standards  Government  & Regulation  Industry   Certifying Bodies  Colleges & Universities  Professional  Certifications  Cybersecurity Curriculum  Maintenance     Figure 1.
Factors Impacting the Maintenance of   Cybersecurity Certifications   looking   to  better   curricula.
By   into  certification  design   While overlap naturally exists, these factors represent the  significant inputs requiring consideration by a certifying body  in  maintaining  their  certifications.
This  level  of  research  is  difficult for academics in IHLs to conduct on their own so it  makes  sense  to  leverage  the  extensive  knowledge  gathering  that  goes  improve  cybersecurity  to  professional  certifications through organizations like (ISC)2, academics can  tap  into  additional  sources  of  feedback  to  better  ensure  the  relevance and currency of their own cybersecurity curriculum.
To  illustrate  the  notion  that  IHLs  can  use  professional  certifications as a guide for keeping cybersecurity curriculum  current, consider the topic of mobile device security.
In 2013,  Patten and Harris (2013) proposed that future IT professionals  should be  aware  of  and  learn  how  to  secure  mobile  devices.
As it pertains to the CEH, the EC-Council  was  covering  topics  relating  to  mobile  devices,  and  this  material was already published in third-party exam preparation  texts (Oriyano, 2014).
Mobile security was then upgraded into  a  larger  topic  for  the  CEHv9  exam.
In  this  case,  we  can  see  that  the  EC-Council  was  making changes to its exams to adapt to technological changes  as  IHLs  began  modernizing  their  curricula.
Generally  speaking,  certification  bodies  keep  up  with  technology  and  industry  changes  and  can  therefore  be  good  sources  of  forward-looking guidance.

CASE STUDY     To  understand  the  development  and  maintenance  of  cybersecurity  curriculum,  we  utilized  qualitative  methods.
Following  best  practices  on  qualitative  research  (Bryman,  2012)  and  case  study  applications  in  education  (Merriam,  1998),  we  examined  a  case  study  involving  a  medium-sized  private university in the eastern United States.
At this school,  the  Cybersecurity  program  is  part  of  the  Information  &  Technology  Management  department  within  the  College  of  Business, which is accredited by the Association to Advance  Collegiate  Schools  of  Business  (AACSB).
The  department  also  supports  a  Management  Information  Systems  (MIS)  major,  which  is  accredited  by  the  Accreditation  Board  for  Engineering  and  Technology  (ABET).
The  Cybersecurity  program officially began in August 2015, while the planning  began  eighteen  months  prior.
After courses were designed but before the new courses  were  first  offered  to  students,  (ISC)2  updated  the  CBK  by  emphasizing  certain  security  and  assessment/testing)  and  re-aligning  other  topics  under  a  different  domain  structure.
(like  asset   topics   Extending  beyond  the  CISSP,  content  areas  for  the  Certified  Information  Security  Auditor  (CISA),  Certified  Information  Security  Manager  (CISM),  and  CEH  credentials  were  compared  to  the  existing  curriculum.
Second,  these  four  certifications  were  chosen  because  they  are  all  listed  on  the  ANSI/ISO  17024  certification  list  and  generally  cover  a  broad  range  of  topics  related  to  cybersecurity.
Finally,  multiple  industry  surveys  indicate  that  these  four  certifications  are  highly  requested  in  job postings.
Another survey placed the CISSP,  CISM,  and  CEH  in  the  top  four  of  information  security  certifications  across  four  major  job  boards  (Tittel,  2016).

While  Table  1  and  Appendices  A  and  B reflect  our  case  study, any cybersecurity program can replicate this table and  adjust  it  to  fit  their  program.
DISCUSSION   for   of  Using  Certifications     4.1  Appropriateness  Curriculum Shaping  Using  professional  certifications  as  a  guide  for  course  development  is  not  new  and  has  been  done  in  the  area  of  accounting systems and control (Walters, 2007).
As previously  mentioned,  35%  of  cybersecurity  job  postings  requested  a  professional certification.
While no single certification should  be  recommended,  certifications  are  currently  an  important  measure  that  the  industry  has  for  regulating  professional  competency, thus academic programs should work to integrate  certifications  into  their  curriculum  (Fulton,  Lawrence,  and  Clouse, 2014).
Some  academic  viewpoints  hold   that  emphasizing  professional  certifications  focuses  too  much  on  yesterday’s  technology  and  thus  IHLs  should  focus  on  training  a  new  workforce  rather  than  building  one  based  on  certifications  (Locasto  et  al.,  2011).
This  suggestion  is  valid  –  any  cybersecurity  program  should  not  focus  too  much  on  professional  certifications  at  the  expense  of  introducing  students to emerging developments in the field.
By  taking  a  strategic  approach to selecting a few key certifications to integrate into  a  curriculum,  there  should  be  plenty  of  room  left  to  incorporate  new  technologies.
At  the  university  described  in  the  case  above,  the  faculty  deemed  it  important  to  expose  students  to  emerging  issues  related  to  critical  infrastructure,  cyber-physical  systems,  and  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT).
Therefore,  we  recommend  faculty  should  find  ways to cover material that includes emerging technology and  tools  while  also  promoting  certifications  so  students  can  develop  a  rounded  and  relevant  education  as  they  enter  the  workforce  (Kaspersky  and  Furnell,  2014).
Other  certifications  focus  on  specific  technologies  or  infrastructure  (e.g.,  Certified  Cloud  Security  Professional).
The  Global  Information  Assurance  Certification  (GIAC)  offers dozens of specialized certifications aimed to ensure an  individual  has  the  skills  necessary  as  a  practitioner  (GIAC,  2016a).
Advanced certifications like the Licensed Penetration  Tester  (LPT)  and  Offensive  Security  Certified  Professional  (OSCP) require a hands-on penetration test demonstration in a  cyber-range.
While only a select few certifications require the  demonstration of skills, nearly all discuss the use of tools and  techniques  within  the  field  of  cybersecurity.
Schools  should  implement  experiential  or  hands-on  material  wherever  possible.
This is advisable as Manson and Pike (2014) argue  that  changes  in  technology  and  security  threats  require  aspiring  cybersecurity  professionals  to  set  a  goal  of  10,000  hours  of  relevant,  hands-on  skill  development  over  a  long- term career.
Providing hands-on experience, even if only in a  simulated  lab  environment,  instills  in  students  not  only  the  ability to understand what must be done to secure systems, but  also  how  to  go  about  doing  it.
Thus,  in  addition  to  certification,  cybersecurity  programs  should  promote  hands-on  experiential  learning.
In addition to cyber competitions and games like  capture the flag, hands-on focused certifications can be used to  advance the notion that cybersecurity students need such skills  development.
4.3 Capstone Courses in Cybersecurity  Capstones  courses  present  opportunities  to  prepare  students  for  entry-level  professional  certifications.
As  cybersecurity majors, they will have taken the full curriculum  allowing a capstone class to be taught at a high-level and serve  as a certification exam prep course.
Once they graduate and are  working 40-60 hour weeks, it becomes increasingly difficult to  set aside time to study.
To overcome time constraints and the  lack of motivation to study, many working professionals spend  money on exam “boot camps” or other preparation materials.
This  approach  is  helpful  considering  the   Journal of Information Systems Education, Vol.
While  some  cybersecurity  certifications  do  not  require  (e.g.,  Security+  and  GIAC  Security  work  experience  Essentials),  other  certifications  require  a  minimum  length  of  professional experience in the field.
In some cases, completing  a  university  degree  program  reduces  the  amount  of  work  experience  required  (e.g.,  CISA,  CISM,  and  CISSP).
Work  experience  requirements  should  not,  however,  discourage  IHLs from modeling capstones after certification materials nor  should it discourage current students from taking certification  exams.
Many certifying bodies allow an individual’s passing  score to be valid for several years, allowing them time to gain  the  experience  required  to  become  fully  certified.
Further,  some  certifications  offer  alternate  designations  to  those  who  have passed the exam but are still working toward fulfillment  of  the  experience  requirement.
Moreover,  many  certifications  have  significant  overlap  in  coverage, so if a capstone concentrates on one certification, it  will  also  cover  in  large  measure  other  major  certifications.
While  we  should  not  limit  curricula  updates  to  certification  material,  staying  in  tune  with  certifications  can  reduce  the  cybersecurity  field.
research  changes   time  needed   Many  cybersecurity  programs  in  the  United  States  seek  designations by the Department of Homeland Security and the  National  Security  Agency  (DHS/NSA).
These  U.S.  federal  government  organizations  have  been  leaders  in  helping  to  shape cybersecurity and information assurance curriculum for  years  and  have  made  significant  positive  contributions  to  cybersecurity  education.
The  approach  advocated  in  this  paper,  however,  can  be  used  to  maintain  any  IHL’s  cybersecurity curriculum whether designated by DHS/NSA or  not.
This is important because our approach can be applied by  any  IHL  globally  since  most  certifications,  such  as  from  (ISC)2, are international in scope whereas DHS/NSA are U.S.- centric.
Finally,  based  on  our  extant  review  of  the  scholarly  literature, a gap exists in the literature regarding maintaining  cybersecurity programs.
Developing course objectives that are  relevant and applicable is of key significance to such a rapidly          developing  field  like  cybersecurity.
RECOMMENDATIONS     Faculty  managing  undergraduate  cybersecurity  curriculum  should  include  an  annual  review  of  key  professional  certifications  and  monitor  them  for  updates  and  changes.
Most certification bodies require annual continuing education  credits  to  ensure  that  certified  individuals  remain  current  on  evolving threats and trends in the cybersecurity field.
Having  access to such training materials provides an effective way for  academics to identify potential improvements to their existing  curricula.
The  cybersecurity  faculty  either  obtained  these  certifications  or  are  active  members  in  the  societies  supporting  them.
Any  changes  to  these certifications are readily identifiable and can be used to  update security courses.
These  include  seeking  inputs  from  stakeholders,  employers,  graduates,  and  faculty.
Guidance can also come from academic accreditation  bodies, such as the developing Cyber Science standards from  ABET  (Gibson  et  al.,  2015).
In  keeping  curriculum  current,  faculty can also solicit the help of graduates and local industry  leaders to be members of an advisory board.
international  standards,  particularly   Other well-known or possible resources that may be used  to  guide  the  maintenance  of  cybersecurity  programs  include  using  the  growing  ISO/IEC  27000  series  of  information  security  publications.
Academics  could look to these industry standards as a guide  for  certain  course  coverage,  such  as  using  ISO  27000  standards  in  covering  Governance,  Risk,  and  Compliance  (GRC) topics.
Government’s  National  Initiative  for  Cybersecurity  Education (NICE).
NICE promotes standards of cybersecurity  education,  training,  and  workforce  development  throughout  the  U.S.
This  effort  publishes  the  National  Cybersecurity  Workforce Framework that gives a blueprint to organize and  describe  cybersecurity  work  into  knowledge,  skills,  and  abilities (KSAs).
This comprehensive framework can be used  to maintain and update cybersecurity curricula as it is used to  help define professional requirements in cybersecurity (DHS,  2016).
As  of  this  writing,  the  framework  is  being  developed  into a U.S. standard (NIST, 2016).

ISSN 2574-3872   Professionalizing Cybersecurity:  A path to universal standards and status Francesca Spidalieri and Sean Kern August 2014   Executive Summary The Internet, together with the information communications technology (ICT) that  underpins it, has revolutionized our world and opened new opportunities for the global  economy and civilization at large.
Our reliance on this complex infrastructure, however,  has also exposed new vulnerabilities and opened the door to a wide range of nefarious  cyber activities by a spectrum of hackers, criminals, terrorists, state and non-state actors.
Government agencies and private-sector companies alike have been victims of cyber  thefts of sensitive information, cybercrime, and cyber disruption (e.g.
The nation’s critical infrastructure, including the electric power grid, air traffic  control systems, financial systems, and communication networks, is vulnerable to cyber  attacks.
Compounding the problem is the reality that, as computing and communications  technologies become more ubiquitous throughout society, the incentives to compromise the  security of these systems will continue to rise.
The proliferating array of cyber threats has been accompanied by another realization:  that there is a shortage of highly trained cybersecurity professionals who are capable of  addressing the threat at hand.
The dearth of advanced cybersecurity professionals can be felt  across all sectors, from the federal government to the private sector, with potential negative  consequences for national security, economic vitality, as well as public health and safety.
As  cyber threats continue to increase in scope and sophistication—and as more people become  aware of these vulnerabilities—there is a growing demand for professionals who can secure  our networks and combat cyber attacks.
Educating, recruiting, training, and hiring these  cybersecurity professionals, however, has proven to be very difficult.
This report addresses the widening gap between the supply of qualified information security  professionals and the demand for skilled workers to secure critical infrastructure and  cyberspace.
It seeks to shed light on the current status of the cybersecurity labor market,  which is best characterized as a fog of competing requirements, disjointed development  programs, conflicting definitions of security roles and functions, and highly fragmented,  competing, and often confusing professional certifications.
It also aims to recognize the   Francesca Spidalieri is the Cyber Leadership Fellow at the Pell Center for International Relations and Public  Policy at Salve Regina University.

This report offers a general overview of the cybersecurity industry with commentary from  cyber experts currently working in the field.
These insights will serve as points of departure  for understanding specific recommendations made to guide a comprehensive cybersecurity  professional development plan and create a career path that rewards and retains cyber talents in  both civilian and military workforces.
The report proposes an alternative to the current, ad hoc,  decentralized approach to cybersecurity workforce development.
Instead, this report proposes the  creation of a national professional association in cybersecurity to solidify the field as a profession,  to support individuals engaged in this profession, to establish professional standards and  prescribe education and training, and, finally, to support the public good.
The report’s emphasis on a path forward in professionalizing the cybersecurity workforce also  means that in the interest of brevity, coverage in this report cannot be comprehensive.

Cybersecurity as a People Problem That people, companies, and governments worldwide are increasingly dependent on information  and ICT is no longer a matter of debate.
With everything from our thermostats to our cars now  increasingly connected to the Internet, the era of the “Internet of Things” (IoT) promises a time  of near-ubiquitous connectivity and interconnection.
In light of everyone’s increased dependence  on the Internet and ICT, cybersecurity has become one of the most critical issues facing states in  the 21st century.
With widespread Internet use and ever-more critical information being stored  online, the specter of cyber attacks loom large.
“Our adversaries in the cyber realm include spies  from nation-states who seek our secrets and intellectual property; organized criminals who want to  steal our identities and money; terrorists who aspire to attack our power grid, water supply, or other  infrastructure; and hacktivist groups who are trying to make a political or social statement,” said  Richard McFeely, FBI Executive Assistant Director.1 The security of cyberspace is now paramount,  as it affects national security, economic vitality, public health and safety.
It should come as no  surprise, then, that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has declared the cyber threat  as the nation’s foremost security concern for two years running.
In addition, corporate executives  and board members worldwide have ranked cyber risk as the third highest risk to their business,  behind only taxation and customer loss.2  Another area of concern is that cyber threats could have  debilitating impacts on public health and safety due to the increasingly interconnectedness of  systems that control the distribution of food, water, energy, and essential, life-supporting services.3  1.

2  PELL CENTER for INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS and PUBLIC POLICYDespite the growing scope and sophistication of cyber threats and the development of cyber tools  as technical weapons, there are not enough people equipped with the appropriate knowledge,  skills, and abilities (KSA) to protect the information infrastructure, improve resilience, and  leverage information technology for strategic advantage.4 In cybersecurity, countermeasures  are implemented to reduce risks associated with the vulnerabilities of people, processes, and  technology.
At present, the predominant trend to combat cyber risks among organizations across all  sectors is to pursue the latest security tools and technology.
While technology is certainly important to this effort, there must be an increased focus on people.
No matter how good any particular technology may be, its efficacy is limited if it is not effectively  adopted and implemented by management teams and correctly used by skilled employees who  follow well-defined processes.
Otherwise, vulnerabilities will surface that can be leveraged by both  internal and external threat actors.5 In short, any technology for combating cyber attacks is only as  good as the people who develop, implement, and maintain it.
Cybersecurity issues often start with ordinary technology users who have not received proper  training, do not take security seriously, or prize convenience over security by—consciously or  not—sidestepping basic standards of best practices.
Verizon’s “2012 Data Breach Investigations  Report” estimated that 97 percent of reported successful breaches could have been avoided with  simple, inexpensive corrective actions.6 Their 2014 report reaffirmed that conclusion, noting that  “nearly every incident [analyzed] involved some element of human error.”7 The Ponemon Institute’s  2013 “Cost of Data Breach Study” concluded that 35 percent of breaches were caused by human  error and 29 percent were due to system glitches and information technology and business process  failures.8  Other post-mortems, such as the high-profile data breach of U.S. retailer Target Corp,  similarly concluded that breaches would be avoidable if organizations followed commonly known  cybersecurity best practices.
To put it more bluntly: many successful cyber attacks—whatever their  motive or intent—are enabled by operator error and lack of training.
In this environment, cyber  strategic leadership9 and a team of skilled cybersecurity workers remain key to the survival of any  enterprise in the digital age.

3  PELL CENTER for INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS and PUBLIC POLICYAchieving cybersecurity, in other words, is far more than a technical problem: it is fundamentally  a people problem.
And since cybersecurity is a people problem, there must be a human  solution.
In short, there needs to be a professional cybersercurity workforce, represented by  a number of cybersecurity specializations, capable of inculcating standard best practices into  standard professional bodies of knowledge thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of  cybersecurity technologies and strategies.
A comprehensive cybersecurity professional development  plan, led by senior decision makers, would in turn help reduce cyber risks to our national security,  economic prosperity, public health and safety.
This paper leverages the existing body of knowledge and initiatives to show the value of  professionalizing the cybersecurity workforce at the level of each cybersecurity specialization,  and to provide a roadmap to move forward in this effort.
When discussing cybersecurity as a  “profession,” this report refers to the traditional definition found in the New Fontana Dictionary of  Modern Thought: “a vocation that is characterized by formal qualifications based upon education,  apprenticeship, and examinations, regulatory bodies with powers to admit and discipline members,  and some degree of monopoly rights.”  Reducing the Fog of the Cybersecurity Industry Reports of cyber crimes, cyber espionage, data breaches, and cyber incidents surface on a daily  basis.
Companies are hacked, national defense technology and the industrial base are compromised,  military and civilian government sites are penetrated, sensitive data is stolen, and ransomware  behaves like the many-headed Hydra.
While cyber threats continue to grow in both scope and  sophistication, however, the cyber workforce is falling behind.
The U.S. is struggling to develop  and sustain the talent to protect, detect, defend, and respond to these threats.10 The need for a  knowledgeable and experienced cyber workforce has never been greater, yet its present capabilities  lag behind the current threat.
In addition to the significant shortage of cyber talents, the expansion of technology innovations— such as web, mobile, cloud, social media, and IoT—are introducing new vulnerabilities and  increasing companies’ exploitable attack surfaces.11 Too many organizations lack the right skills and  qualified personnel to proactively assess the likelihood of a breach, to detect network infiltrations,  and to mitigate attacks once they are underway.
Research suggests and our interviews confirm that  even organizations that can meet most of their needs internally still face difficulties in recruiting or  retaining cybersecurity professionals with advanced skills.12 The present situation, in other words, is  a dangerous one.
A recently released study from Cisco Systems Inc. linked the shortage of nearly one million skilled  cybersecurity professionals to growing cyber attacks.13 In addition, a report from (ISC)2 concluded  10.

The talent shortage in the  cybersecurity labor market is exacerbated by corporate leaders who should be responsible for  building a team of trusted experts, fostering a culture of security, and developing sound strategies to  protect their digital investments, but instead display tendencies to treat cybersecurity as an isolated  “IT problem” best left to their already overwhelmed IT departments.
As research has shown, their natural optimism bias combined with a lack of  understanding of cybersecurity risks often leads business executives to believe that their company’s  security posture is better than it actually is, or that since they have hired the right management  team, they in turn must have hired the right people to manage security risks.17   Managers, who do understand the need for qualified and certified cybersecurity professionals  face other challenges.
They do not always know how to express their security needs in realistic job  descriptions, or assess the KSA of potential cybersecurity candidates.
It doesn’t help that no single  existing certification addresses all the KSAs required for a particular position.
As a result, managers  often struggle to or place new cyber hires in jobs commensurate with their skill level.
And  businesses in general are essentially driving blind when it comes to how much, if any, investment is  required to recruit, develop, and retain top cyber talents to maintain and defend their networks.
On the other hand, qualified cybersecurity practitioners do not always find the job positions  advertised commensurate with the apparent demand, and cannot rely on a defined career path  to assess KSA requirements for continued professional development leading to opportunities for  lateral or upward movement.

Exacerbating the overall problem is that many organizations’ attitude towards cybersecurity is  aloof and unconcerned—many organizations appear to reason that no matter how bad cyber  threats are, they won’t be a victim because they are too small, not as profitable, not part of a critical  sector, already well-protected, and so forth.
There are endless reasons they can give themselves to  justify not adopting proper cybersecurity measures.
As a result, they operate under a false sense of  security, which, when compounded by the additional factors highlighted above, creates a fog in the  cybersecurity industry.
This fog further increases the mismatch between perception of cyber risks  and reality, and between the different types of training, education, certifications, and competencies  needed by the cybersecurity workforce.
The end result is confusion on both the enterprise and  workforce sides of cybersecurity, a situation which only benefits hackers and attackers.
To address the acute gap between market demand and supply in the cybersecurity industry—a gap  that is only expected to widen as cyber jobs grow at an annual rate of 11.3 percent globally over the  next five years18—cyber professionals (and the companies that will hire them) need a standardized  way to measure their training, education, and experience in cybersecurity.
As Steve Katz, the very first  Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) in the industry, stated:   Information security professionals must also look at themselves as part of the entire business  model, not just security, and be able to fully understand the business they are in, the problems and  business risks that a certain product or service is going to address, and how to integrate security  into business, and business into security.
Their soft skills should include being able to communicate,  negotiate, and develop relationships within the C-suite, so that they can be present when privacy or  a corporate strategy is being discussed.19   On the other hand, modern boards of directors and C-suites must view cyber risk as a component  of their overall enterprise risk management process rather than a compliance issue, and take  ownership of their company’s cybersecurity.
Companies must integrate cybersecurity front and  center into their daily activities and must anchor it into their decision-making processes in a  holistic and comprehensive manner.
No company or agency can ignore cybersecurity; it is the  source of systemic risk and potential damaging “material effects” that can hurt an organization’s  profits, value, brand, and financial future.20 In an effort to combat these potential downsides,  employers need a standard approach by which they can evaluate cyber workers’ skills and   7, 2014.

The Role of Education  Over 300,000 cybersecurity jobs are estimated to be vacant just in the United States today.
Among  those, 83 percent require a bachelor’s degree or higher.21 From the federal government to the  Fortune 500, the demand for educated and experienced cybersecurity professionals is only expected  to increase in upcoming years, especially as organizations face data breaches and cybersecurity  threats with unprecedented frequency.
Yet there remains a noticeable mismatch between this  burgeoning demand for cybersecurity talents and the efforts underway to “develop professionals  who can build and manage secure, reliable digital infrastructures and effectively identify, mitigate,  and plan for asymmetric and blended threats.”22 Although only one of the components—and not  a sufficient one alone—in the creation of a sound cybersecurity workforce, education must be the  first step in developing a cadre of cybersecurity professionals and cyber-strategic leaders who are  prepared to meet tomorrow’s challenges today.
The U.S. government addressed the education of a cyber workforce as part of its 2008  Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI), which included a number of mutually  reinforcing initiatives designed to secure the United States in cyberspace.
Its eighth (unclassified)  initiative out of 12 called to:  Expand cyber education.
While billions of dollars are being spent on  new technologies to secure the U.S. Government in cyberspace, it is the  people with the right knowledge, skills, and abilities to implement those  technologies who will determine success.
However there are not enough  cybersecurity experts within the Federal Government or private sector  to implement the CNCI, nor is there an adequately established Federal  cybersecurity career field.
Existing cybersecurity training and personnel  development programs, while good, are limited in focus and lack unity of  effort.
In order to effectively ensure our continued technical advantage and  future cybersecurity, we must develop a technologically-skilled and cyber- savvy workforce and an effective pipeline of future employees.
It will take a  national strategy, similar to the effort to upgrade science and mathematics  education in the 1950’s, to meet this challenge.23  Many of today’s activities, including the establishment of the National Initiative for Cybersecurity  Education (NICE) and other government-founded efforts aimed at moving more cybersecurity  graduates through the pipeline, date back to the CNCI and the money allocated in support of  21.

The National Science Foundation  (NSF) and the National Security Agency (NSA), among others, have started to address this issue.
The NSF and the Department of Education, for example, are leading the Formal Cybersecurity  Education component of NICE, aimed at bolstering cybersecurity education programs  encompassing kindergarten through twelfth grade, higher education and vocational programs.25  The NSA and Department of Homeland Security (DHS), on the other hand, have jointly sponsored  the National Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance (IA) Education (CAE/IAE),  Research (CAR-R), and CAE Cyber Operations.26 These programs are deeply technical and centered  around information assurance—limited to the protection and management of information-related  risk—and rarely pursue broader multi-disciplinary approaches commensurate with the complexity  of cybersecurity.27 Moreover, even if the centers-of-excellence designation had the potential to  represent an educational baseline, only 186 institutions have received the CAE accreditation— which is less than 5 percent of all American colleges and universities.
And although cybersecurity  is not inherently a governmental concern, the only existing cybersecurity-related education  accreditation program to date is government sponsored.
As Melissa Hathaway, who led the development of the CNCI and then President Obama’s  Cybersecurity Policy Review, stated:   The problem is that we are not even teaching the basics of computer security  in schools and university programs in general, and that cybersecurity is  still not part of most computer science departments and other university  departments’ core curricula... We will never get to the workforce needed  until we have the majority of schools and universities teaching the basic  skill sets required in the field and this becomes part of a standardized  core curriculum, just like basic history, math, and other basic courses.
Cybersecurity, after all, is part of everyday life!28  It must also be recognized that “cybersecurity is a complex subject whose understanding requires   24.

As discussed in the sections  above, skilled workers, as well as institutional and business leaders, must have a deep understanding  of cybersecurity.
These individuals need not have specific training in engineering or programming,  but they must be equipped with knowledge of the cyber context in which they operate to harness  the right tools, people, strategies, and solutions to achieve competitive advantage.
Despite the pressing need to educate future generations about cybersecurity, few American  universities and colleges offer courses or degree programs that combine cybersecurity technology,  policy, business and other disciplines, and even fewer encourage collaboration among departments  to optimize their efforts and insights available from cross-fertilization.30 Current cybersecurity  programs should be expanded and incorporated into all major non-technical university programs  and technical professional development programs, from community colleges and technical  institutes to graduate and doctoral degree programs, as well as professional certification programs  (e.g.
the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)).
In addition, these programs  will need a comprehensive framework to integrate common best practices, core curriculum tenets,  and minimum standard requirements.
There is an obvious mechanism for the federal government to impose minimum cybersecurity  curricular standards.
The Department of Education could provide “financial assistance to  individuals, schools, states and their subdivisions to assure that trained manpower of sufficient  quality and quantity meet the national standard of the U.S.”31 This, in fact, was the intention of  the 1958 National Defense Education Act (NDEA), signed into law at a time of growing concern  that U.S. scientists were falling behind scientists in the Soviet Union.
It aimed at strengthening the  national defense and encouraging and assisting in the expansion and improvement of educational  programs to meet critical national needs.32 This federal policy helped establish minimum  educational standards, particularly in math and science, and authorized both National Defense  Fellowships and loans for collegiate education and state educational agencies.
A national investment  in cybersecurity education programs—perhaps in the form of matching funds—would effectively  establish minimum curriculum standards for cybersecurity.
If it could be done for the Cold War, it  can be done for the age of Cyber War.
The challenges inherent in creating a federally-dictated, top-down set of standards for cybersecurity  education and training are not modest.

Professionalization of the cybersecurity industry, as this report  argues, requires a nationally recognized, independent professional association, whose responsibility  would also include establishing standardized core curricula in information technology and  cybersecurity for educational institutions at all levels, and encouraging intra-university  collaboration (more in subsequent sections).
The blistering pace of technological change and the cyber threats that accompany it are only going  to accelerate, and the lack of a well-educated security workforce poses dire consequences for our  collective future.
If the mismatch between our cyber defense capabilities and skilled professionals  remains on its current trajectory, cyber threats will have the potential to undo much of the  economic, social, and military gains that cyberspace has enabled.
Educational institutions and  organizations of all sizes and sectors have a tremendous opportunity to turn this challenge into an  opportunity.
Cybersecurity can make good business sense and those organizations embracing cyber  opportunities stand to gain significant advantage in an increasingly competitive global marketplace.
The missing piece to navigate the fog of the cybersecurity industry, however, is to create an  overarching organizational framework to develop, manage, and oversee the training, education,  certification, and continuous professional development of a qualified cybersecurity workforce along  a career continuum, and to guide leaders across society in placing the right people with the right  knowledge, skills, and abilities in the right position to create a safer, more secure cyberspace for  everyone.
A Proactive Approach to Cybersecurity Workforce Professionalization Evans and Reeder expressed the challenge elegantly:  In many ways, cybersecurity is similar to 19th century medicine—a  growing field dealing with real threats with lots of self-taught practitioners  only some of whom know what they are doing.
The evolution of the  practice of medicine mandated different skills and specialties coupled with  qualifications and assessments.
In medicine, we now have accreditation  standards and professional certifications by specialty.
We can afford nothing  less in the world of cyberspace.33  Numerous studies have pointed out the necessity to grow and retain a pool of highly skilled cyber  professionals.
Reports by the Center for Strategic and International Studies,34 the Department of  Homeland Security’s Homeland Security Advisory Council,35 RAND Corporation,36 and Booz Allen  Hamilton37—just to name a few—have outlined the difficulty of meeting cybersecurity manpower  needs, especially in the federal government, and offered a series of recommendations to manage the  33.

The problem, however, is that while the critical  shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals has been widely recognized and several initiatives  attempting to address the issues of cyber workforce development have been advanced, none of these  efforts have yielded comprehensive results.
Indeed, there has been no significant attempt to create  a unifying strategy to prioritize existing and planned cybersecurity initiatives.
Neither have efforts  succeeded in establishing accreditation standards for cybersecurity curricula and certifications  nor elevating and standardizing the competencies of the cyber workforce.
In addition, efforts have  failed to address the lack of an overall, integrated approach to fill the lower and middle-void of  adequately skilled workers, let alone address professionalization of the cybersecurity industry.
As James Lewis, Director of the CSIS Strategic Technologies Program, explains, “Professionalization  would be the mastery of certain skill sets essential for success, some way to demonstrate that  you have acquired those skills, and then that you can refresh that knowledge through continuing  education.
If you think about professionals in any field,” he continued, “they need to have the right  skills and competencies, and they have to be able to show that they posses them.” Thus, in order to  professionalize the cybersecurity industry, “you have to first identify the body of knowledge and  skills that professionals need to have to work effectively in this field; then find a way to provide  those skills through education and training programs; and finally have a way to accredit this process  (both those identifying the body of knowledge and those teaching it) and attest that the individual  has acquired those skills.38  One of the strongest arguments against professionalization, however, is that cybersecurity is still  too new a field in which to introduce professionalization standards for its practitioners and that  it is changing too rapidly to impose standards now—which some argue that would risk imposing  rigidity on a growing and changing field.
This was the conclusion reached by the National  Research Council (NRC) in 2013 and detailed in their report “Professionalizing the Nation’s  Cybersecurity Workforce?
First, they argued that the knowledge, skills, and abilities required  of the cybersecurity workforce are so dynamic that one cannot effectively establish a baseline  for professionalization.
Second, complementary to the first, the report asserted the knowledge  and competencies required by the cybersecurity workforce are too broad and diverse to enable  professionalization.
Finally, they noted that in a time where demand for cybersecurity workers far  exceeds supply, professionalization would create additional barriers to entry.39   The evidence in the cyber realm and the historical similarities with the professionalization of other  important fields in our society, however, undercut the strength of the NRC’s argument.
First, the  cybersecurity workforce should not be treated as a homogenous population.
NICE is the recognized  authoritative source in this area and has defined the cybersecurity workforce in a consistent way  using a standardized lexicon, but has not suggested that it should be referred to as a singular,   38.

The NICE National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework 2.0 (NCWF) used  an organizational construct to group similar types of cybersecurity work around seven broad  categories or areas of practice:40  • Securely Provision; • Operate and Maintain; • Protect and Defend;  • Investigate; • Collect and Operate; • Analyze; and • Oversight and Development.
Obviously, not all specialties are created equal in terms of criticality and  job requirements, and they exhibit varying levels of maturity.
The tide started to turn when it was decided that the  risk to the public was simply too great to bear, and a movement began to minimize “self-taught  practitioners” and professionalize the industry.
The AMA accelerated the professionalization of medicine and the establishment of minimum  standards in medical training, education and apprenticeship requirements to gain entry to the  profession.
The same should be done in the cybersecurity field with a similar cybersecurity national  body and professional associations.
Like the medical profession of the nineteenth century, the  present cybersecurity industry features too many “self-taught practitioners” who have varying  40.

Unlike the medical field of the 1840’s, the cybersecurity  field is increasingly chaotic and fragmented.
Secondly, specific cybersecurity competencies and a baseline of capabilities can actually be  identified and categorized, while additional KSAs can always be developed and added as technology  advances and new risks emerge.
In fact, as another report from the National Research Council  recognizes:   The specifics of cybersecurity change rapidly, but the fundamental concepts  and principles endure, or at least they change much more slowly.
These  concepts and principles are approximately independent of particular  cybersecurity technologies or incidents, although they manifest themselves  in a wide variety of different technologies and incidents.43    Ongoing professional education is required in any critical profession, such as medical doctors,  where there exists a rapidly changing body of knowledge.
This will be a necessary requirement in  the cybersecurity field as well, because although the specific instances of new attacks may change  quickly, the mechanisms to manage them will have some permanence and basic security concepts  and principles will persist, while additional KSAs will be developed over time.
Some commercial  certification organizations already account for this, requiring members to accrue various levels  of continuing professional education annually.44  Moreover, in comparison to the 24 general  certificates and 125 subspecialty certificates listed by the American Board of Medical Specialties,  the seven categories and 31 specialty areas identified by NICE show that the breadth and depth of  cybersecurity specialties is certainly comparable to that of the medical professions.
As for the argument that the nation’s cybersecurity workforce is too broad and diverse to be  treated as a single profession, this again can be compared to the medical field, where there is a  large array of specialties—surgery, psychiatry, family care, etc.—in which individuals can pursue  careers.
Cybersecurity jobs have a similar degree of variation: one can be a network administrator  responsible for analysis, installation, and configuration of a small company’s network, or a security  engineer in charge of protecting a major nuclear plant from cyber threats and exposure.
As NICE  explains in its report “A Historical Review of How Occupations Become Professions,” each job  category of the medical field, like in cybersecurity, can be broken down further into specialty areas,  each with “a unique role and set of knowledge and skills that are required to perform this role.
As with most fields, some responsibilities, knowledge, and skills might be the same for multiple  roles.”45 For example, while in smaller organizations with fewer staff, cybersecurity job positions  may require competence across different specialty areas, larger organizations with very large staffing  abilities, may be able to assemble a team of cybersecurity professionals, with each member being a  skilled practitioner in one primary specialty.
National Research Council, “At The Nexus of Cybersecurity and Public Policy,” 2014.
13  PELL CENTER for INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS and PUBLIC POLICYThe problem, however, remains the astounding breadth of concerns in the cyber realm, the lack  of a clear definition of security roles among application designers, developers, quality assurance  teams, and operations teams, and the lack of specific job-role task details that continue to fragment  the industry and cause additional confusion.
Even the existing training frameworks—such as  those developed by NICE, USCYBERCOM, and the Defense Information Systems Agency—which  use very similar wording for job roles and functions, do not provide details on the specific tasks  performed as part of those job roles.46 Professionalization would help in clarifying the particular  duties regularly performed while in a specific job role, the skill level required to be effective at  those duties, and the specific professional standards and requirements necessary for the position,  regardless of the sector or organizational structure in which the cybersecurity professional is  employed.
By identifying the knowledge, ability, and skills necessary to operate competently within a  functional role, the varying levels of formal education, licensure, work experience, and knowledge  requirements could be similarly identified.
Defining roles and knowledge requirements, for  instance, helps medical workers in various specialties gain recognition and acceptance, and it helps  ensure that medical workers meet sufficient and consistent knowledge requirements.
In addition,  professionalization has the potential to attract workers, orient the workforce to more effectively  consider future factors that may affect the evolution of the profession, and establish a long-term  path to enhancing quality of the workforce with a standardized set of specific KSAs.
Finally, the NRC report argues that professionalization would impose additional barriers to entry  in the cybersecurity industry and inadvertently screen out suitable candidates.
By definition, more rigorous curriculum standards, higher  training, and more stringent certification requirements will create some barriers to entry.
Higher  barriers to entry, indeed, can yield some desired benefits: they are intended to reduce the risks that  unqualified workers pose to organizations once positioned to serve in a specific role.
Just like in  the medical field, some cybersecurity positions pose greater risks to security, public health and  safety, and economic viability than others.
For example, the insider threat posed by an unqualified  or disgruntled employee with trusted access to sensitive systems and information—think of  Edward Snowden—could cause incredible damage.
Not all cybersecurity positions are created  equal in terms of job requirements and risk posed to organizations and therefore the risk may  well be worth a diminished supply due to the barriers imposed by professionalization.47 The rigor  of professionalization may also discourage those who are not dedicated to professional ethical  standards, just like being subject to a polygraph examination may deter potential candidates with  something to hide.

14  PELL CENTER for INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS and PUBLIC POLICYrespect to core values and ethical standards, which would ensure that the critical mission, business  information, and infrastructure cyber workers are entrusted with, are privileged and protected.
The NRC report’s main conclusion is that attempts to professionalize a cybersecurity occupation  should only be undertaken when the field is “well-defined” with “stable knowledge and skill  requirements,” and that there is credible evidence of skill deficiencies in the workforce.
This is a  fair statement and any workforce development strategy must first consider the challenges inherent  in this highly dynamic field.
It is also important to recognize that the field will  remain dynamic, as it is the reflection of the constant innovation and creativity spurred on by rapid  decreases in the time and effort to deploy technology in scale.
As Jane Holl Lute, former deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and current  president of the Council on CyberSecurity, and Michael Assante, a member of the Council’s board  of directors and a former president of the National Board of Information Security Examiners,  eloquently argued:   We can no longer live in a cyber world without performance expectations for  those who design, operate, and maintain our systems and our networks...
The many women and men we know in the civilian cyber workforce want to  be held to higher standards, they want to demonstrate their ability to practice  their trade with skill and precision, and they want clear acknowledgment  of their proficiency.
Using acknowledged processes and standards of best  practice and professionalism to ensure that these individuals are competent,  prepared and capable of making correct decisions day-to-day and during an  emergency will be critical to the success of any effort to improve the security  of information networks.48  Currently, there are a number of independent initiatives in both the public and private sectors to  address specific aspects of cybersecurity workforce development, but there is no unifying strategy  connecting them all.
As a result, the longer the cybersecurity workforce waits to professionalize,  the more unwieldy this environment will become, which will make it increasingly difficult to  unify all stakeholders under a common strategy in the future.
As the old adage goes, that which is  not measured is not managed.
A cybersecurity workforce professionalization strategy can serve  as a framework to measure progress.
Nature also shows us that systems tend to disorder unless  properly managed.
But “professionalization will require an organized effort; we cannot wait for the  field to figure itself out,” explained Michael Assante.49 Our country’s increasing reliance on secure,  48.

And in the background of all this looms a grim reality: as we wait for cybersecurity workforce  professionalization, cyber threats and cyber attacks will only grow.
As Dr. Ernest McDuffie, Lead for the NICE initiative, reminded us “there is no unifying  strategy or single organization that could take ownership of the field at the moment.” In other  words, there is no focal point or center of gravity around which to organize.
“There are a lot of  organizations with great expertise,” Dr. McDuffie continued, “but no central organization with  the credibility and capability to serve this role.
The only organization with the credibility [to lead  the professionalization of this field] would be a hybrid between academia and business, with an  international presence and recognized track record.”50   This report, however, argues that an effective alternative to today’s ad hoc, decentralized approach  to enhancing cybersecurity, will require the development of a comprehensive framework for  professionalization and the establishment of a national, independent, non-profit organization to  serve as a representative body and clearinghouse for the cybersecurity profession.
We recognize  that the professionalization process would unfold over the course of several years and would  involve stakeholders from government, academic institutions, profit and non-profit organizations,  public and private sector entities, formal and informal groups.
This process would leverage existing  organizations while also require the development of new ones as well.
Our hope is that this work catalyzes additional research and efforts to unify this complex eco- system under a common purpose, seek ways to mobilize commitment to change, develop a  shared vision, foster consensus, and institutionalize a commonly accepted approach.
The actions  or strategic objectives proposed in the next section are intended to help professionalize the  cybersecurity workforce following the traditional model of professionalization as represented by the  medical profession:  security profession, similar to AMA in the medical field;  • Create a nationally recognized, regulatory body to serve as a clearinghouse for the cyber- • Establish member professional associations for each specialty; • Develop a common body of knowledge (CBK) for each specialty; • Establish and maintain rigorous standards of training and education; • Establish certification/licensing requirements; • Establish apprenticeship, residency requirements for each specialty; and • Establish a standard code of ethics.
Recommended Action Plan The following are recommended strategic objectives to guide a national, comprehensive effort to  professionalize the cybersecurity workforce.
Author’s interview with Dr. Ernest McDuffie, Lead for the federal National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education   (NICE), June 2, 2014.

Training  & Education  Code of Ethics  Accreditation  Apprenticeships   & Internships  Common Body of Knowledge  Certification & Licensure  any reference to “cybersecurity specialty” is in the context of the specialties defined in the NICE  Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (See appendix 1).
Recognizing that cybersecurity is a complex socio-technical-economic ecosystem, populated  by many different stakeholders relevant to its professionalization, a comprehensive strategy will  necessarily include academic institutions, for-profit and non-profit organizations, public and private  sector entities, formal and informal groups, and recognized cyber-strategic leaders in the field.
Strategic Objective 1:  Create an Independent, Nationally Recognized Cybersecurity Professional Body.
The best way to move forward in a comprehensive manner is to first and foremost leverage  existing efforts and initiatives to advance cybersecurity workforce professionalization.
Given the  complexity of the current cybersecurity eco-system, however, there is no single organization in  existence today that has the credibility and capability to serve as a national professional body.
An  alliance or consortium of existing professional associations could serve as the starting point to  create a national, independent governance body, similar to other private and public collaborative  models in practice.
This organization would serve as a national representative of the cybersecurity   17  PELL CENTER for INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS and PUBLIC POLICYprofession as a whole, much like the AMA.
Through education, development of core curriculum  standards, licensure advocacy, leadership training, multi-disciplinary networking, and outreach,  this body would enhance the image of its members and their ability to ethically and professionally  practice the cybersecurity profession.
A national independent body would also be responsible, or  at least initially help the federal government, establish minimum core curriculum standards and  requirements in information technology and cybersecurity for educational institutions at all levels.
A more mature national organization would include representatives of the following (some of  whom may overlap):  • Major private sector organizations that employ cybersecurity professionals; • Cybersecurity-related member associations; • Cybersecurity-related certifying bodies; • Universities with major cyber education and research programs; and  • Key federal government agencies.
Appendix 2 provides a sample of existing professional computing organizations compiled by the  NIST Computing Resource Center that would be considered important stakeholders in this body.
To this group, we would also include the Council on Cyber Security, the Institute of Electronic and  Electrical Engineers (IEEE), and the Association of Computing Machinery.
Ultimately, this body would serve as a clearinghouse for the cybersecurity profession and a focal  point for education, training, communication, participation, facilitation, support, and negotiation  within the cybersecurity workforce.
As Michael Assante noted “security is so  diverse and shared that organizing around it conflicts with any known organizational principle...
Most organizations think, ‘If we tried to professionalize the workforce, we would probably fail so it  is not worth our investment.’”51    An alternative organizational construct could be a Federally Funded Research and Development  Center (FFRDC).
SEI revolutionized the development of complex  software systems through the development of the Capability Maturity Model-Integrated (CMMI).
The CMMI became the basis of DoD’s software procurement contracts and, as a result, the  industry standard in the private sector too.
The CMMI has now spun off into a separate, entirely  independent organization.
Currently, NIST is reviewing proposals for a first Cybersecurity FFRDC  to be managed by the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCOE).
A complementary cybersecurity workforce  mandate, that would follow the recommended strategic objectives exemplified in this report, could  see the same success achieved by SEI.
18  PELL CENTER for INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS and PUBLIC POLICY“clever model” that would ameliorate his and others’ concerns of leaving professionalization merely  to “commercial interests.”52  Strategic Objective 2:  Establish Cybersecurity Specialty Professional Associations.
The national body cannot and should not determine the specific professionalization requirements  for each cybersecurity specialty.
This role should belong to the senior practitioners of a given  cybersecurity specialty who would serve as governing members of the specialty association.
This model is similar  to the AMA, which includes professional associations for each medical specialty (e.g., American  Academy of Physician Assistants).
Once  established, each professional specialty association would serve as principals, along with the  national body, in implementing the remaining strategic objectives.
Strategic Objective 3:  Develop and Maintain a Professional Common Body of Knowledge (CBK).
Each specialty professional association will be responsible for developing and maintaining its  specialty’s professional body of knowledge.
Initially, the NIST National Cybersecurity Workforce  Framework’s specialty knowledge, skills, and abilities, and DHS/NSA’s Centers for Academic  Excellence criteria could be used as a basis for each specialty’s body of knowledge.
Other  sources may come from existing CBKs defined by organizations that offer relevant professional  certifications for the given specialty.
One example would be the body of knowledge developed  by the International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium (ISC)2 Certified  Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), which is applicable to the specialties included  in the “Oversight and Development” category.
Strategic Objective 4:  Establish and Maintain Required Levels of Training and Education.
A profession typically requires rigorous, extensive training and education.
Training is typically task- centered, while education is related to developing   comprehensive knowledge of a subject.
Not all  specialties will have the same levels of training and education much like the medical profession’s  Certified Nursing Assistants, Licensed Practical Nurses, Registered Nurses, Physician’s Assistants,  Physicians, and Hospital Administrators.
Each have varying levels of training and education  commensurate with the body of knowledge and skills needed for specific core functions in order to  reduce the risk of a practitioner failing a patient, their organization, or the public at large.
19  PELL CENTER for INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS and PUBLIC POLICYAcademic Excellence in IA’s accreditation standards.
Since this field is not inherently governmental  and information assurance is only one component of cybersecurity, it is reasonable to envision  a future in which the NSA and DHS may serve as advisory board members to the national body  and relevant specialty associations in order to ensure their cybersecurity workforce needs are  met, but would no longer maintain an accreditation program in-house.
Instead, the cybersecurity  community would leverage an existing accreditation body, such as the Accreditation Board for  Engineering and Technology (ABET), for cybersecurity education accreditation.
ABET currently accredits 3100 science, technology, engineering, and management (STEM)  programs at 670 institutions in 24 countries.
It has two accreditation commissions that would  suit the requirements of the cybersecurity profession, the Computing Accreditation Commission  and the Engineering Accreditation Commission.
Additionally, ABET has member associations  affiliated with areas related to cybersecurity.
Each of ABET’s members has responsibility for an  academic discipline within applied science, computing, engineering, or engineering technology at  the postsecondary level.
Urgency is needed in this area as a number of cyber-related undergraduate and graduate programs  are being developed across the United States and abroad.53  Without formal accreditation  guidelines, it will be difficult to assess the efficacy of those programs.
Defining ways to accredit and  measure education and training is an essential task under this objective.
Strategic Objective 5:  Establish Certification/Licensing Requirements.
Professions typically have some regulatory body responsible for establishing certification and/ or licensing requirements before a candidate can actually serve in a professional capacity.
Some  professions have state or even national level licensing requirements.
For example, a physician is  required to take a state exam in each state he or she wishes to practice.
The main issue is that most of the professional cybersecurity certifications currently available are  “focused on demonstrating expertise in documenting compliance with policy and statutes rather  than expertise in actually reducing risk through identification, prevention, and intervention.”54  Compounding the problem is “the chaos of the certification process and the many home-brewed,  self-declared certifications, with all their competing ideas,” stated Tony Sager.55 “We do not even  have a way to compare all the different certifications, and the certifying companies do not really  have an interest in collaborating,” Mr. Sager continued.
Sean Kern et al., “Senior Cyber Leadership: Why a Technically Cybersecurity Workforce is Not Enough,” Cyber Se-  curity Forum Initiative, http://www.csfi.us/pubdocs/?id=39.
20  PELL CENTER for INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS and PUBLIC POLICYBringing the existing multiple, competing, mostly profit-driven certifying organizations, that offer  different certifications for many of the cybersecurity specialties, under a common umbrella may  prove the most challenging task in this strategy.
Cybersecurity practitioners, hiring authorities, and customers would be better served by a single  specialty certification.
Unfortunately, current certifications do not map directly to defined  cybersecurity specialties.
For example, a number of different cybersecurity specialties require some  level of knowledge of penetration testing.
These same specialties require knowledge in other areas  that are covered by yet other certifications.
It would make more sense to certify a professional in a  given specialty than requiring him to hold multiple certifications in order to prove his knowledge  for a required specialty.
Each professional specialty association should develop its own certification regime, which would  include a tough educational component and a monitored practical component.
The professional specialty  association would work with existing related commercial certifying organizations to develop a  best of breed certification regime based on each specialty’s CBK.
Existing commercial certifying  organizations would still play a critical role in the cybersecurity workforce development, but  their roles and responsibilities would shift.
Rather than owning the intellectual property of their  organically developed CBKs, certifying organizations would contribute to the CBK maintained by  a given specialty association.
Certifying organizations would still provide training and certification  administration, just as they do now.
This is somewhat similar to SANS’ recent decision to transition  its “20 Critical Security Controls” intellectual property to the Council on Cyber Security.
It would  require a degree of altruism and honest acknowledgment of the benefits of the proposed regime on  the part of the certifying organizations, but the existing business model would still hold.
Appendix 3 lists a number of current certifying bodies compiled by the NIST Computing Resource  Center as well as the joint NICE and Federal CIO Council’s 2012 “IT Workforce Assessment for  Cybersecurity” report.
Strategic Objective 6:  Establish Apprenticeship, Residency Requirements.
Professions are traditionally organized into various tiers based on experience, such as apprentice,  journeyman, and master.
These tiers, in addition to being differentiated by education, training, and  certification requirements, are also differentiated by apprenticeship and/or residency requirements.
In practice, the junior professional is placed under the direct supervision of a seasoned, professional  for a predetermined period of time.
This provides a controlled environment in which the junior  professional can practice the knowledge and skills gained through previous training, education, and  experience.
Some cybersecurity specialties may not require apprenticeship or residencies.
21  PELL CENTER for INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS and PUBLIC POLICYStrategic Objective 7:  Establish a Standard Code of Ethics.
Most certification organizations currently have a code of ethics.
For example, (ISC)2 has a code of  ethics consisting of four canons:  structure;  • Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infra- • Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally; • Provide diligent and competent service to principals; and • Advance and protect the profession.56  The Information Systems Security Association (ISSA) also has a code of ethics.
There would  be little to no conflict in developing a standard code of ethics for the national body and special  member associations.
The core values and ethical standards developed in each association would  in turn ensure that the critical mission, business information, and infrastructure that specific cyber  workers are entrusted with, are privileged and protected.
Conclusion Our cybersecurity issues and needs are complex and widespread, but a comprehensive  cybersecurity professional development plan and career path to reward and retain cyber talents  have yet to emerge.
Given the importance of cyber to our national security and standard of living,  we need a professional workforce with common KSAs within a professional framework and a  number of specializations, just as the medical, legal, and other critical professions do.
There must  be consistency of expectation of the specific cyber KSAs that the workforce obtains from any given  educational delivery method and source.
To do this as effectively and transparently as possible in  this global environment, the cyber community must professionalize their craft.
This report proposed an alternative to the ad hoc, decentralized approach to enhancing  cybersecurity that marks today’s cybersecurity profession.
The establishment of a nationally  recognized, professional association to serve as a clearinghouse for the cybersecurity profession  (similar to AMA in the medical field), and of additional member professional associations for each  identified specialty within the cybersecurity industry, would help reduce the risk currently posed  by a wide variety of cyber threats.
Although an alliance or consortium of existing professional  associations could serve as the starting point for this body, a department or agency sponsored  FFRDC (similar to the DoD’s Software Engineering Institute) would be better suited to serve as the  organizing construct for this new entity.
Indeed, an FFRDC with the mandate to plan, direct, and  oversee the implementation of the strategic objectives outlined in this report could mitigate and  potentially eliminate the current fog of competing requirements, disjointed development programs,  conflicting definitions of security roles and functions, and highly fragmented and inadequate  professional certifications, resulting in reduced risk and increased competitive advantage for all.

1   FROM DEFENSE TO CYBER DEFENSE     Transitioning from a military career to civilian life can be challenging and take some  planning.
As a veteran, you are likely ahead of your civilian counterparts when it comes to preparing  for a career in cybersecurity.
For example, you’ve likely been exposed to security  procedures and can tackle challenges in a timely and systematic fashion.
You may also  have already acquired a security clearance during your service which can help you compete  for a federal position.
The cybersecurity field is full of open positions for people with or without degrees.
Cybersecurity professionals report an average salary of $116,0003 per year, and yet many  cybersecurity jobs go unfilled.
In fact, in January 2016, Forbes reported that over 209,000  cybersecurity jobs were still open.4     There is no better fit for a trained, experienced veteran than a needed, growing, and  lucrative field protecting the nation that they love.

Cybersecurity focuses on protecting  computers, networks, and information  from unauthorized access or attack.
Essentially, if a device is connected to the Internet, it is vulnerable to attack and needs  to be protected.
See what you have in common with cybersecurity professionals.
You’re probably wondering if you’d be any good at  cybersecurity.
You might have more things in  common with cybersecurity professionals than you  think!
The table below features various traits of top  cybersecurity professionals.
In addition to your personal interests, your military experience may also help pave the  way to a cybersecurity career.
Many companies prefer to hire veterans for cybersecurity  positions because of the training these candidates received in the military.
Additionally,  some work may require navigating systems and tracking down persistent threats: skills  you may have gained through your service.
Just as your personality and training made you successful in the military, those same  traits and skills could make you successful on various cybersecurity teams.
You will  encounter a variety of working environments in a cybersecurity career that will require  agility, critical thinking, and curiosity.
Your military service likely equipped you with the ability to quickly process information  for security decisions, maintain situational awareness, learn on your feet, and respond  in challenging situations: all these abilities may help you be successful in a  cybersecurity career as well.
3   P  R  E  P  A  R  E   PLAN YOUR CYBERSECURITY CAREER     The cybersecurity field offers many different jobs in many different environments.
You  might defend a network, create organizational strategies, or even try to breach systems  to test vulnerabilities.
Understanding some of the requirements you may need for the  job that looks most interesting to you is the first step in planning your new career.
You have a number of available options to achieve  your career goals in cybersecurity.
In many cases,  obtaining certain certifications is all you need to get  a cybersecurity job, while other employers may require a related degree and/or training  for cybersecurity jobs.
As a veteran, you can take advantage of free training and degree  scholarship opportunities to enter the cybersecurity field.
Some of the specific certifications, technical training, and/or cyber-related degrees that  employers require can be completed in a relatively short period of time with little or no  cost, while others will require a longer and possibly more costly investment in your time  and money.
Remember - using the Post-9/11 GI Bill, you can get up to 36 months of financial  support for education and training for graduate and undergraduate degrees,  vocational/technical training, correspondence training, licensing and national testing  programs, and tutorial assistance to prepare you for a career in cybersecurity.
Short-Term Plan  The very nature of cybersecurity reacts to the fast-paced  changing threats and vulnerabilities to our nation’s  information systems.
That’s why  cybersecurity training and certifications are important.
There are hundreds of training  courses ranging from general security awareness and online user safety, to highly  technical advanced certifications.
Popular Cybersecurity Certifications    1.
ISC2 Certified Information Systems   Security Professional (CISSP)   5.
CompTIA A+   Security-related certifications are also a  prerequisite for many commercial cybersecurity and defense-related IT security jobs.
Long-Term Plan  Certifications are a great way to quickly make you more  competitive to employers, but many jobs also require a   cyber-related degree.
The list below details general expectations you may face in  the cybersecurity field.
Associate’s Degree: Certain entry-level cybersecurity positions may be obtainable  with a two-year associate’s degree in computer science, cybersecurity or a related  field, plus work experience.
Advancing in the Cybersecurity and/or Information  Technology profession usually requires at least a bachelor’s degree.
Bachelor’s Degree: Plan on obtaining a four-year degree to compete for most   cybersecurity jobs.
A bachelor’s degree in computer science, information  technology, engineering or a related discipline can be a good start.
Some employers  may also look for advanced training, industry certifications or work experience.
Master’s Degree: Some employers hiring for cybersecurity positions may require   candidates to have an advanced degree, such as a Master of Science in  Cybersecurity, Information Assurance, or a related field.
Cyber Roles  As part of your short- and long-term plan, it will be important to  identify which cybersecurity area(s) you are most interested in  exploring.
The National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework provides a common language on  cyber roles and helps define professional requirements in cybersecurity.
The Workforce  Framework organizes cybersecurity into seven high-level categories, each comprised of  several Specialty Areas.
This organizing structure is based on extensive job analyses that groups together work  and workers that share common major functions, regardless of job titles or other  occupational terms.
The Workforce Framework includes many categories of work you  might find familiar from your military career.
5   P  R  E  P  A  R  E      P  R  E  P  A  R  E   While technical expertise is sought after, not all cybersecurity work opportunities require  deep technical expertise – there is a strong need for individuals with experience and  skills in program management, people management, policy development, and training  – to name just a few.
For example, when you explore categories like Oversight and Development and Operate  and Maintain you’ll find less technical roles like:   ?
Education and Training (developing, planning, and delivering training on   cybersecurity subjects)   ?
Strategic Planning and Policy Development (defining strategy and policy direction   as it pertains to cybersecurity standards and operations)    ?
Knowledge Management (managing, organizing, and securing access to   information)   ?
Data Administration (Developing and administering databases that allow for the   storage, query, and utilization of data)   Exploring the Workforce Framework, its categories and specialty areas will give you a  good feel for the wide range of options available to you as you prepare to launch your  new cybersecurity career.
