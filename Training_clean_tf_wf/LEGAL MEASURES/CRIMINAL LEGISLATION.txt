As such, the report aims to help developing countries better understand the national and  international  implications  of  growing  cyberthreats,  to  assess  the  requirements  of  existing  national,  regional and international instruments, and to assist countries in establishing a sound legal foundation.
This report provides a comprehensive overview of the most relevant topics linked to the legal aspects of  cybercrime and focuses on the demands of developing countries.
Due to the transnational dimension of  cybercrime,  the  legal  instruments  are  the  same  for  developing  and  developed  countries.
However,  the  references used were selected for the benefit of developing countries, in addition to a broad selection of  resources  provided  for  a  more  in-depth  study  of  the  different  topics.
Whenever  possible,  publicly  available sources were used, including many free-of-charge editions of online law journals.
This  includes  descriptions  of  how  crimes  are  committed  and  explanations of the most widespread cybercrime offences such as hacking, identity theft and denial-of- service  attacks.
After a summary of some of the activities undertaken by  international and regional organizations in the fight against cybercrime (Chapter 5), it continues with an  analysis  of  different  legal  approaches  with  regard  to  substantive  criminal  law,  procedural  law,  digital  evidence,  international  cooperation  and  the  responsibility  of  Internet  service  providers  (Chapter  6),  including examples of international approaches as well as good-practice examples from national solutions.
This publication addresses the first of the seven strategic goals of the ITU Global Cybersecurity Agenda  (GCA), which calls for the elaboration of strategies for the development of cybercrime legislation that is  globally applicable and interoperable with existing national and regional legislative measures, as well as  addressing the approach to organizing national cybersecurity efforts under ITU-D Study Group 1 Question  22/1.
Establishing the appropriate legal infrastructure is an integral component of a national cybersecurity  strategy.
Guadalajara,  2010)  of  the  ITU  Plenipotentiary  Conference,  on  Strengthening  the  role  of  ITU  in  building confidence and security in the use of information and communication technologies.
The adoption  by  all  countries  of  appropriate  legislation  against  the  misuse  of  ICTs  for  criminal  or  other  purposes,  including  activities  intended  to  affect  the  integrity  of  national  critical  information  infrastructures,  is  central  to  achieving  global  cybersecurity.
Since  threats  can  originate  anywhere  around  the  globe,  the  challenges  are  inherently  international  in  scope  and  require  international  cooperation,  investigative  assistance,  and  common  substantive  and  procedural  provisions.
Thus,  it  is  important  that  countries  harmonize their legal frameworks to combat cybercrime and facilitate international cooperation.

Infrastructure and services   1.1  The  Internet  is  one  of  the  fastest-growing  areas  of  technical  infrastructure  development.1 Today,  information and communication technologies (ICTs) are omnipresent and the trend towards digitization is  growing.
The  demand  for  Internet  and  computer  connectivity  has  led  to  the  integration  of  computer  technology into products that have usually functioned without it, such as cars and buildings.2 Electricity  supply, transportation infrastructure, military services and logistics – virtually all modern services depend  on the use of ICTs.3   Although  the  development  of  new  technologies  is  focused  mainly  on  meeting  consumer  demands  in  western countries, developing countries can also benefit from new technologies.4 With the availability of  long-distance wireless communication technologies such as WiMAX5 and computer systems that are now  available for less than USD 2006, many more people in developing countries should have easier access to  the Internet and related products and services.7  The  influence  of  ICTs  on  society  goes  far  beyond  establishing  basic  information  infrastructure.
The  availability of ICTs is a foundation for development in the creation, availability and use of network-based  services.8 E-mails  have  displaced  traditional  letters9;  online  web  representation  is  nowadays  more  important  for  businesses  than  printed  publicity  materials;10 and  Internet-based  communication  and  phone services are growing faster than landline communications.11   The  availability  of  ICTs  and  new  network-based  services  offer  a  number  of  advantages  for  society  in  general, especially for developing countries.
ICT applications, such as e-government, e-commerce, e-education, e-health and e-environment, are seen  as enablers for development, as they provide an efficient channel to deliver a wide range of basic services  in  remote  and  rural  areas.
ICT  applications  can  facilitate  the  achievement  of  millennium  development  targets,  reducing  poverty  and  improving  health  and  environmental  conditions  in  developing  countries.
Given  the  right  approach,  context  and  implementation  processes,  investments  in  ICT  applications  and  tools can result in productivity and quality improvements.
In turn, ICT applications may release technical  and human capacity and enable greater access to basic services.
In this regard, online identity theft and  the act of capturing another person’s credentials and/or personal information via the Internet with the  intent to fraudulently reuse it for criminal purposes is now one of the main threats to further deployment  of e-government and e-business services.12  The costs of Internet services are often also much lower than comparable services outside the network.13  E-mail  services  are  often  available  free  of  charge  or  cost  very  little  compared  to  traditional  postal  services.14 The  online  encyclopaedia  Wikipedia15 can  be  used  free  of  charge,  as  can  hundreds  of  online  hosting  services.16 Lower  costs  are  important,  as  they  enable  services  to  be  used  by  many  more  users,  including  people  with  only  limited  income.
Given  the  limited  financial  resources  of  many  people  in  developing countries, the Internet enables them to use services they may not otherwise have access to  outside the network.
1   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response   Advantages and risks     1.2  The introduction of ICTs into many aspects of everyday life has led to the development of the modern  concept  of  the  information  society.
17  This  development  of  the  information  society  offers  great  opportunities.18 Unhindered access to information can support democracy, as the flow of information is  taken out of the control of state authorities (as has happened, for example, in Eastern Europe and North  Africa).19 Technical developments have improved daily life – for example, online banking and shopping,  the use of mobile data services and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) telephony are just some examples  of how far the integration of ICTs into our daily lives has advanced.20   However, the growth of the information society is accompanied by new and serious threats.21 Essential  services  such  as  water  and  electricity  supply  now  rely  on  ICTs.22 Cars,  traffic  control,  elevators,  air  conditioning and telephones also depend on the smooth functioning of ICTs.23 Attacks against information  infrastructure and Internet services now have the potential to harm society in new and critical ways.24   Attacks against information infrastructure and Internet services have already taken place.25 Online fraud  and hacking attacks are just some examples of computer-related crimes that are committed on a large  scale  every  day.26 The  financial  damage  caused  by  cybercrime  is  reported  to  be  enormous.27 In  2003  alone, malicious software caused damages of up to USD 17 billion.28 By some estimates, revenues from  cybercrime exceeded USD 100 billion in 2007, outstripping the illegal trade in drugs for the first time.29  Nearly 60 per cent of businesses in the United States believe that cybercrime is more costly to them than  physical  crime.
30  These  estimates  clearly  demonstrate  the  importance  of  protecting  information  infrastructures.31  Most  of  the  above-mentioned  attacks  against  computer  infrastructure  are  not  necessarily  targeting  critical infrastructure.
However, the malicious software “Stuxnet” that was discovered in 2010 underlines  the threat of attacks focusing on critical infrastructure.32 The software, with more than 4 000 functions33,  focused on computer systems running software that is typically used to control critical infrastructure.34   Cybersecurity and cybercrime   1.3  Cybercrime and cybersecurity are issues that can hardly be separated in an interconnected environment.
Cybersecurity36 plays an important role in the ongoing development of information technology, as well as  Internet  services.
37 Enhancing  cybersecurity  and  protecting  critical  information  infrastructures  are  essential  to  each  nation’s  security  and  economic  well-being.
Making  the  Internet  safer  (and  protecting  Internet users) has become integral to the development of new services as well as government policy.38  Deterring  cybercrime  is  an  integral  component  of  a  national  cybersecurity  and  critical  information  infrastructure  protection  strategy.
In  particular,  this  includes  the  adoption  of  appropriate  legislation  against the misuse of ICTs for criminal or other purposes and activities intended to affect the integrity of  national critical infrastructures.
At the national level, this is a shared responsibility requiring coordinated  action  related  to  prevention,  preparation,  response  and  recovery  from  incidents  on  the  part  of  government authorities, the private sector and citizens.
At the regional and international level, this entails  cooperation and coordination with relevant partners.
The formulation and implementation of a national  framework  and  strategy  for  cybersecurity  thus  requires  a  comprehensive  approach.39 Cybersecurity  strategies – for example, the development of technical protection systems or the education of users to  prevent  them  from  becoming  victims  of  cybercrime  –  can  help  to  reduce  the  risk  of  cybercrime.40 The  development and support of cybersecurity strategies are a vital element in the fight against cybercrime.41   The  legal,  technical  and  institutional  challenges  posed  by  the  issue  of  cybersecurity  are  global  and  far- reaching, and can only be addressed through a coherent strategy taking into account the role of different  stakeholders and existing initiatives, within a framework of international cooperation.42 In this regard, the  World  Summit  on  the  Information  Society  (WSIS)43 recognized  the  real  and  significant  risks  posed  by  inadequate cybersecurity and the proliferation of cybercrime.
The provisions of §§ 108-110 of the WSIS  Tunis  Agenda  for  the  Information  Society44,  including  the  Annex,  set  out  a  plan  for  multistakeholder   2   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     implementation  at  the  international  level  of  the  WSIS  Geneva  Plan  of  Action, 45  describing  the  multistakeholder implementation process according to eleven action lines and allocating responsibilities  for  facilitating  implementation  of  the  different  action  lines.
At  WSIS,  world  leaders  and  governments  designated ITU to facilitate the implementation of WSIS Action Line C5, dedicated to building confidence  and security in the use of ICTs.46  In  this  regard,  the  ITU  Secretary-General  launched the  Global  Cybersecurity  Agenda  (GCA)47 on  17  May  2007, alongside partners from governments, industry, regional and international organizations, academic  and research institutions.
The GCA is a global framework for dialogue and international cooperation to  coordinate  the  international  response  to  the  growing  challenges  to  cybersecurity  and  to  enhance  confidence and security in the information society.
It builds on existing work, initiatives and partnerships  with  the  objective  of  proposing  global  strategies  to  address  today’s  challenges  related  to  building  confidence  and  security  in  the  use  of  ICTs.
Within  ITU,  the  GCA  complements  existing  ITU  work  programmes by facilitating the implementation of the three ITU Sectors’ cybersecurity activities, within a  framework of international cooperation.
The  Global  Cybersecurity  Agenda  has  seven  main  strategic  goals,  built  on  five  work  areas:  1) Legal  measures; 2) Technical and procedural measures; 3) Organizational structures; 4) Capacity building; and  5) International cooperation.48  The  fight  against  cybercrime  needs  a  comprehensive  approach.
Given  that  technical  measures  alone  cannot  prevent  any  crime,  it  is  critical  that  law-enforcement  agencies  are  allowed  to  investigate  and  prosecute  cybercrime  effectively.49 Among  the  GCA  work  areas,  “Legal  measures”  focuses  on  how  to  address  the  legislative  challenges  posed  by  criminal  activities  committed  over  ICT  networks  in  an  internationally  compatible  manner.
“Technical  and  procedural  measures”  focuses  on  key  measures  to  promote  adoption  of  enhanced  approaches  to  improve  security  and  risk  management  in  cyberspace,  including  accreditation  schemes,  protocols  and  standards.
“Organizational  structures”  focuses  on  the  prevention,  detection,  response  to  and  crisis  management  of  cyberattacks,  including  the  protection  of  critical  information  infrastructure  systems.
“Capacity  building”  focuses  on  elaborating  strategies  for  capacity-building  mechanisms  to  raise  awareness,  transfer  know-how  and  boost  cybersecurity  on  the  national policy agenda.
Finally, “International cooperation” focuses on international cooperation, dialogue  and coordination in dealing with cyberthreats.
The  development  of  adequate  legislation  and  within  this  approach  the  development  of  a  cybercrime- related  legal  framework  is  an  essential  part  of  a  cybersecurity  strategy.
This  requires  first  of  all  the  necessary substantive criminal law provisions to criminalize acts such as computer fraud, illegal access,  data  interference,  copyright  violations  and  child  pornography.50 The  fact  that  provisions  exist  in  the  criminal code that are applicable to similar acts committed outside the network does not mean that they  can be applied to acts committed over the Internet as well.51 Therefore, a thorough analysis of current  national laws is vital to identify any possible gaps.52 Apart from substantive criminal law provisions53, the  law-enforcement  agencies  need  the  necessary  tools  and  instruments  to  investigate  cybercrime.54 Such  investigations themselves present a number of challenges.55 Perpetrators can act from nearly any location  in the world and take measures to mask their identity.56 The tools and instruments needed to investigate  cybercrime can be quite different from those used to investigate ordinary crimes.57   International dimensions of cybercrime   1.4  Cybercrime  often  has  an  international  dimension.58 E-mails  with  illegal  content  often  pass  through  a  number of countries during the transfer from sender to recipient, or illegal content is stored outside the  country.59 Within  cybercrime  investigations,  close  cooperation  between  the  countries  involved  is  very  important.60 The  existing  mutual  legal  assistance  agreements  are  based  on  formal,  complex  and  often  time-consuming procedures, and in addition often do not cover computer-specific investigations.61 Setting  up  procedures  for  quick  response  to  incidents,  as  well  as  requests  for  international  cooperation,  is  therefore vital.62       3   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     A number of countries base their mutual legal assistance regime on the principle of “dual criminality”.63  Investigations  on  a  global  level  are  generally  limited  to  those  crimes  that  are  criminalized  in  all  participating  countries.
The criminalization of illegal content  differs in various countries.65 Material that can lawfully be distributed in one country can easily be illegal  in another country.66  The computer technology currently in use is basically the same around the world.67 Apart from language  issues and power adapters, there is very little difference between the computer systems and cell phones  sold  in  Asia  and  those  sold  in  Europe.
An  analogous  situation  arises  in  relation  to  the  Internet.
Due  to  standardization, the network protocols used in countries on the African continent are the same as those  used in the United States.68 Standardization enables users around the world to access the same services  over the Internet.69   The question is what effect the harmonization of global technical standards has on the development of  the national criminal law.
In terms of illegal content, Internet users can access information from around  the world, enabling them to access information available legally abroad that could be illegal in their own  country.
Theoretically,  developments  arising  from  technical  standardization  go  far  beyond  the  globalization  of  technology and services and could lead to the harmonization of national laws.
However, as shown by the  negotiations over the First Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (the “Convention  on Cybercrime”),70 the principles of national law change much more slowly than technical developments.71   Although the Internet may not recognize border controls, there are means to restrict access to certain  information.72 The  access  provider  can  generally  block  certain  websites  and  the  service  provider  that  stores a website can prevent access to information for those users on the basis of IP-addresses linked to a  certain country (“IP-targeting”).73 Both measures can be circumvented, but are nevertheless instruments  that can be used to retain territorial differences in a global network.74 The OpenNet Initiative75 reports  that this kind of censorship is practised by about two dozen countries.76   Consequences for developing countries   1.5  Finding response strategies and solutions to the threat of cybercrime is a major challenge, especially for  developing countries.
A comprehensive anti-cybercrime strategy generally contains technical protection  measures,  as  well  as  legal  instruments.77 The  development  and  implementation  of  these  instruments  need  time.
Technical  protection  measures  are  especially  cost-intensive.78 Developing  countries  need  to  integrate protection measures into the roll-out of the Internet from the beginning, as although this might  initially raise the cost of Internet services, the long-term gains in avoiding the costs and damage inflicted  by  cybercrime  are  large  and  far  outweigh  any  initial  outlays  on  technical  protection  measures  and  network safeguards.79   The  risks  associated  with  weak  protection  measures  could  in  fact  affect  developing  countries  more  intensely, due to their less strict safeguards and protection.80 The ability to protect customers, as well as  firms, is a fundamental requirement not only for regular businesses, but also for online or Internet-based  businesses.
In  the  absence  of  Internet  security,  developing  countries  could  encounter  significant  difficulties promoting e-business and participating in online service industries.
The  development  of  technical  measures  to  promote  cybersecurity  and  proper  cybercrime  legislation  is  vital  for  both  developed  countries  and  developing  countries.
Compared  with  the  costs  of  grafting  safeguards  and  protection  measures  onto  computer  networks  at  a  later  date,  it  is  likely  that  initial  measures taken right from the outset will be less expensive.
Developing countries need to bring their anti- cybercrime strategies into line with international standards from the outset.81   4   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response       1   On the development of the Internet, see: Yang, Miao, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series; Vol.

36   The term “Cybersecurity” is used to summarize various activities and ITU-T Recommendation X.1205 “Overview of   cybersecurity” provides a definition, description of technologies, and network protection principles: “Cybersecurity is  the collection of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches,  actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies that can be used to protect the cyberenvironment and  organization and user’s assets.
Organization and user’s assets include connected computing devices, personnel,  infrastructure, applications, services, telecommunication systems, and the totality of transmitted and/or stored  information in the cyberenvironment.
Cybersecurity strives to ensure the attainment and maintenance of the security  properties of the organization and user’s assets against relevant security risks in the cyberenvironment.
The general  security objectives comprise the following: Availability; Integrity, which may include authenticity and non-repudiation;  Confidentiality.” Also see: ITU, List of Security-Related Terms and Definitions, available at: www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu- t/oth/0A/0D/T0A0D00000A0002MSWE.doc.

Most reports, guides or publications on cybercrime begin by defining the terms82 “computer crime” and  “cybercrime”.83 In  this  context,  various  approaches  have  been  adopted  in  recent  decades  to  develop  a  precise  definition  for  both  terms.84 Before  providing  an  overview  of  the  debate  and  evaluating  the  approaches,  it  is  useful  to  determine  the  relationship  between  “cybercrime”  and  “computer-related  crimes”.85 Without  going  into  detail  at  this  stage,  the  term  “cybercrime”  is  narrower  than  computer- related  crimes  as  it  has  to  involve  a  computer  network.
Computer-related  crimes  cover  even  those  offences that bear no relation to a network, but only affect stand-alone computer systems.
During the 10th United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, two  definitions were developed within a related workshop:86 Cybercrime in a narrow sense (computer crime)  covers  any  illegal  behaviour  directed  by  means  of  electronic  operations  that  target  the  security  of  computer  systems  and  the  data  processed  by  them.
Cybercrime  in  a  broader  sense  (computer-related  crimes)  covers  any  illegal  behaviour  committed  by  means  of,  or  in  relation  to,  a  computer  system  or  network, including such crimes as illegal possession and offering or distributing information by means of a  computer system or network.87   One common definition describes cybercrime as any activity in which computers or networks are a tool, a  target or a place of criminal activity.88 There are several difficulties with this broad definition.
Another  broader  definition  is  provided  in  Article 1.1  of  the  Stanford  Draft  International  Convention to Enhance Protection from Cyber Crime and Terrorism (the “Stanford Draft”),89 which points  out that cybercrime refers to acts in respect to cybersystems.90   Some definitions try to take objectives or intentions into account and define cybercrime more precisely91,  such as “computer-mediated activities which are either illegal or considered illicit by certain parties and  which can be conducted through global electronic networks”.92 These more refined descriptions exclude  cases where physical hardware is used to commit regular crimes, but they risk excluding crimes that are  considered  as  cybercrime  in  international  agreements  such  as  the  Commonwealth  Model  Law  on  Computer  and  Computer-related  Crime  or  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime.93 For  example,  a  person  who  produces  USB94 devices  containing  malicious  software  that  destroys  data  on  computers when the device is connected commits a crime as defined by Article 4 of the Convention on  Cybercrime.95 However, since the act of deleting data using a physical device to copy malicious code has      11   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     not  been  committed  through  global  electronic  networks,  it  would  not  qualify  as  cybercrime  under  the  narrow  definition  above.
Such  acts  would  only  qualify  as  cybercrime  under  a  definition  based  on  a  broader description, including acts such as illegal data interference.
The  variety  of  approaches,  as  well  as  the  related  problems,  demonstrates  that  there  are  considerable  difficulties in defining the terms “computer crime” and “cybercrime”.96 The term “cybercrime” is used to  describe a range of offences including traditional computer crimes, as well as network crimes.
As these  crimes  differ  in  many  ways,  there  is  no  single  criterion  that  could  include  all  acts  mentioned  in  the  different  regional  and  international  legal  approaches  to  address  the  issue,  whilst  excluding  traditional  crimes  that  are  just  facilitated  by  using  hardware.
Computer   2.2  Typology of cybercrime  Bibliography:  Chawki,  Cybercrime  in  France:  An  Overview,  2005,  available  at:  www.crime- research.org/articles/cybercrime-in-france-overview; Gordon/Ford, On the Definition and Classification of  Cybercrime,  page 13-20;  Gordon/Hosmer/Siedsma/Rebovich, Assessing Technology, Methods, and Information for Committing and  Combating  Cyber  Crime,  2003,  available  at:  www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/198421.pdf;  Sieber  in  Organised Crime in Europe: The Threat of Cybercrime, Situation Report 2004.
The term “cybercrime” is used to cover a wide variety of criminal conduct.98 As recognized crimes include  a  broad  range  of  different  offences,  it  is  difficult  to  develop  a  typology  or  classification  system  for  cybercrime.99 One  approach  can  be  found  in  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime,100 which  distinguishes  between four different types of offences101:    Virology,   1,   2006,   2,   No.
Development of computer crime and cybercrime   2.3  The criminal abuse of information technology and the necessary legal response are issues that have been  discussed ever since the technology was introduced.
Over the last 50 years, various solutions have been  implemented at the national and regional levels.
One of the reasons why the topic remains challenging is  the constant technical development, as well as the changing methods and ways in which the offences are  committed.
The 1960s   2.3.1  In  the  1960s,  the  introduction  of  transistor-based  computer  systems,  which  were  smaller  and  less  expensive than vacuum-tube based machines, led to an increase in the use of computer technology.112 At  this  early  stage,  offences  focused  on  physical  damage  to  computer  systems  and  stored  data.113 Such   12   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     incidents  were  reported,  for  example,  in  Canada,  where  in  1969  a  student  riot  caused  a  fire  that  destroyed computer data hosted at the university.114 In the mid 1960s, the United States started a debate  on  the  creation  of  a  central  data-storage  authority  for  all  ministries.115 Within  this  context,  possible  criminal abuse of databases116 and the related risks to privacy117 were discussed.118    The 1970s   2.3.2  In  the  1970s,  the  use  of  computer  systems  and  computer  data  increased  further.119 At  the  end  of  the  decade, an estimated number of 100 000 mainframe computers were operating in the United States.120  With falling prices, computer technology was more widely used within administration and business, and  by  the  public.
They included the illegal use  of computer systems124 and the manipulation125 of  electronic data.126 The shift from manual to computer-operated transactions led to another new form of  crime  –  computer-related  fraud.127 Already  at  this  time,  multimillion  dollar  losses  were  caused  by  computer-related  fraud.
With this development, the number of  computer systems and hence the number of potential targets for criminals again increased.
For the first  time, the targets included a broad range of critical infrastructure.134 One of the side effects of the spread  of computer systems was an increasing interest in software, resulting in the emergence of the first forms  of  software  piracy  and  crimes  related  to  patents.135 The  interconnection  of  computer  systems  brought  about  new  types  of  offence.136 Networks  enabled  offenders  to  enter  a  computer  system  without  being  present  at  the  crime  scene.137 In  addition,  the  possibility  of  distributing  software  through  networks  enabled  offenders  to  spread  malicious  software,  and  more  and  more  computer  viruses  were  discovered.138 Countries started the process of updating their legislation so as to meet the requirements  of  a  changing  criminal  environment.139 International  organizations  also  got  involved  in  the  process.
OECD140 and  the  Council  of  Europe141 set  up  study  groups  to  analyse  the  phenomena  and  evaluate  possibilities for legal response.
The 1990s    2.3.4  The introduction of the graphical interface (“WWW”) in the 1990s that was followed by a rapid growth in  the number of Internet users led to new challenges.
Information legally made available in one country  was available globally – even in countries where the publication of such information was criminalized.142  Another  concern  associated  with  online  services  that  turned  out  to  be  especially  challenging  in  the  investigation of transnational crime was the speed of information exchange.143 Finally, the distribution of  child  pornography  moved  from  physical  exchange  of  books  and  tapes  to  online  distribution  through  websites and Internet services.144 While computer crimes were in general local crimes, the Internet turned  electronic  crimes  into  transnational  crime.
As  a  result,  the  international  community  tackled  the  issue  more  intensively.
UN  General  Assembly  Resolution  45/121  adopted  in  1990145 and  the  manual  for  the  prevention and control of computer-related crimes issued in 1994 are just two examples.146   The 21st Century   2.3.5  As in each preceding decade, new trends in computer crime and cybercrime continued to be discovered in  the  21st  century.
The  first  decade  of  the  new  millennium  was  dominated  by  new,  highly  sophisticated  methods  of  committing  crimes,  such  as  “phishing”,147 and  “botnet  attacks”,148 and  the  emerging  use  of  technology that is more difficult for law  enforcement to handle and investigate, such as “voice-over-IP      13   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     (VoIP) communication”149 and “cloud computing”.150 It is not only the methods that changed, but also the  impact.
Countries and  regional and international organizations have responded to the growing challenges and given response to  cybercrime high priority.

Crime statistics can be used by academia and policy-makers as a basis for discussion and for the ensuing  decision-making process.151 Furthermore, access to precise information on the true extent of cybercrime  would  enable  law-enforcement  agencies  to  improve  anti-cybercrime  strategies,  deter  potential  attacks  and  enact  more  appropriate  and  effective  legislation.
As  further  discussed  below,  they are not intended to be representative of either the global development of cybercrime or of the true  extent of cybercrime at the national level, and are thus presented only to provide an insight into country  information.
•  The  US  Internet  Complaint  Center  reports  a  22.3  per  cent  increase  in  complaints  submitted   relating to cybercrime compared with 2008.154   •  German Crime Statistics indicate that the overall number of Internet-related crimes increased in   2009 by 23.6 per cent compared with 2008.155   It is unclear how representative the statistics are and whether they provide reliable information on the  extent  of  crime.156 There  are  several  difficulties  associated  with  determining  the  global  threat  of  cybercrime on the basis of crime statistics.157  First of all, crime statistics are generally created at the national level and do not reflect the international  scope of the issue.
Even though it would theoretically be possible to combine the available data, such an  approach  would  not  yield  reliable  information  because  of  variations  in  legislation  and  recording  practices.
158  Combining  and  comparing  national  crime  statistics  requires  a  certain  degree  of  compatibility159 that is missing when it comes to cybercrime.
Even if cybercrime data are recorded, they  are not necessarily listed as a separate figure.160 Furthermore, statistics only list crimes that are detected  and reported.161 Especially with regard to cybercrime, there are concerns that the number of unreported  cases  is  significant.162 Businesses  may  fear  that  negative  publicity  could  damage  their  reputation.163 If  a  company announces that hackers have accessed their server, customers may lose faith.
Reported  cases  are  often  the  ones  that  involve  very  large  amounts.167   In summary, statistical information is useful to draw attention to the continuing and growing importance  of the issue, and it is necessary to point out that one of the major challenges related to cybercrime is the  lack  of  reliable  information  on  the  extent  of  the  problem,  as  well  as  on  arrests,  prosecutions  and  convictions.
As already stated, crime statistics often do not list offences separately, and available statistics  on  the  impact  of  cybercrime  are  in  general  unable  to  provide  reliable  information  about  the  scale  or  extent of offences at a level sufficient for policy-makers.168 Without such data, it is difficult to quantify the  impact  of  cybercrime  on  society  and  to  develop  strategies  to  address  the  issue.169 Nevertheless,  the  statistics  can  serve  as  a  basis  for  determining  trends,  which  can  be  found  by  comparing  results  over  several years, and serve as guidance with regard to the process of reporting cybercrime.170    Surveys   2.4.2  The following numbers have been extracted from different surveys.
•   •  Credit card and bank account information are among the most popular information advertised on  underground  economy  services.
The  prices  range  between  USD 0.85-USD 30  (single  credit  card  information) and USD 15-USD 850 (single bank account information).171  In 2007, auction fraud was among the top Internet scams in the US, with an average loss of more  than USD 1 000 per case.172  In 2005, losses as a result of identity-related offences in the US totalled USD 56.6 billion.173   •  •  The  financial  and  personal  cost  of  cybercrime  varies  significantly  among  single  incidents  in   Ireland, generating aggregate costs of over EUR 250 000.174   •  A single computer security company created more than 450 000 new malicious code signatures in   a single quarter.175   •  A quarter of all companies responding to a questionnaire in 2010 reported operational losses as a   result of cybercrime.176   •  Decreasing  number  of  denial-of-service  and  computer-virus  attacks  reported  by  security   professionals between 2004 and 2008.177  In 2009, the United States, China, Brazil, Germany and India were among the countries reporting  most malicious activities.178   •   There are several concerns related to the use of such surveys in determining the extent and impact of  cybercrime.
Another  difficulty  related  to  statistical  information  is  the  fact  that  very  often  either  unreliable  or  non- verifiable information is repeatedly quoted.
One example of this relates to statistical information on the  Internet  child  pornography.
Several  analyses  quote,  for  example,  that  commercial  aspects  of  TopTenReviews  estimated  that  Internet  child  pornography  generates  USD 2.5  billion  annually      15   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     worldwide.181 Yet TopTenReviews does not provide any background information on how the research was  undertaken.
Bearing in mind that TopTenReview claims on its website that the company “gives you the  information you need to make a smart purchase.
Another example of  figures quoted without verifiable reference was discovered by the Wall Street Journal in 2006.182 While  investigating a quotation that child pornography is a multi-billion dollar business (USD 20 billion a year),  the  journalist  reported  that  two  main  documents  containing  information  about  revenues  from  USD 3 billion to 20 billion – a publication from NCMEC and one from the Council of Europe – referred to  institutions that did not confirm the numbers.
As  surveys  often  only  count  incidents  without  providing  further  information  or  details,  it  is  difficult  to  draw  conclusions  with  regard  to  trends.
One  example  is  the  United  States  CSI183 Computer  Crime  and  Security  Survey  2007 that analyses  the number  of computer-related  offences  committed,  among  other  trends.184 It  is  based  on  the  responses  of  494  computer  security  practitioners  from  US  corporations,  government  agencies  and  financial  institutions  in  the  US.185 The  survey  documents  the  number  of  offences reported by respondents between 2000 and 2007.
It shows that, since 2001, the proportion of  respondents who experienced and acknowledged virus attacks or unauthorized access to information (or  system penetration) decreased.
The  surveys  on  cybercrime  are  unable  to  provide  reliable  information  about  the  scale  or  extent  of  offences.186 The uncertainty about the extent to which offences are reported by targets187, as well as the  fact that no explanation for the reducing numbers of cybercrimes can be found, render these statistics  open  to  interpretation.
At  present,  there  is  insufficient  evidence  for  predictions  on  future  trends  and  developments.

Unlike  crimes  that  have  been  covered  by  criminal  law  for  centuries  (such  as  theft  or  murder),  the  computerization  of  offences  is  relatively  recent,  as  computer  systems  and  computer  data  were  only  developed  around  60  years  ago.188 The  effective  prosecution  of  these  acts  requires  that  existing  criminal  law  provisions  not  only  protect  tangible  items  and  physical  documents from manipulation, but also extend to include these new legal principles.189 This section gives  an overview of the most commonly occurring offences included in this category.
Preventing  Paxson,  Attacks,   Phishing  An   Computer   Crimes   Distributed   available   Analysis   16   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response   Illegal access (hacking, cracking)190     2.5.1  The  offence  described  as  “hacking”  refers  to  unlawful  access  to  a  computer  system191,  one  of  oldest  computer-related  crimes.192 Following  the  development  of  computer  networks  (especially  the  Internet),  this crime has become a mass phenomenon.193 Famous targets of hacking attacks include the US National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the US Air Force, the Pentagon, Yahoo, Google, eBay and  the German Government.194   Examples  of  hacking  offences  include  breaking  the  password  of  password-protected  websites195 and  circumventing  password  protection  on  a  computer  system.
But  acts  related  to  the  term  “hacking”  also  include preparatory acts such as the use of faulty hardware or software implementation to illegally obtain  a password to enter a computer system196, setting up “spoofing” websites to make users disclose their  passwords197 and  installing  hardware  and  software-based  keylogging  methods  (e.g.
Some  offenders  limit  their  activities  to  circumventing  security  measures  only  in  order  to  prove  their  abilities.199 Others  act  through  political  motivation  (known  as  “hacktivism”200) – one example is a recent incident involving the main United Nations website.201 In most  cases,  though,  the  motivation  of  the  offender  is  not  limited  to  illicit  access  to  a  computer  system.
Offenders use this access to commit further crimes, such as data espionage, data manipulation or denial- of-service (DoS) attacks.202 In most cases, illegal access to the computer system is only a vital first step.203   Many  analysts  recognize  a  rising  number  of  attempts  to  illegally  access  computer  systems,  with  over  250 million incidents recorded worldwide during the month of August 2007 alone.204 Three main factors  have  supported  the  increasing  number  of  hacking  attacks:  inadequate  and  incomplete  protection  of  computer  systems,  development  of  software  tools  that  automate  the  attacks,  and  the  growing  role  of  private computers as a target of hacking attacks.
Inadequate and incomplete protection of computer systems  Hundreds  of  millions  of  computers  are  connected  to  the  Internet,  and  many  computer  systems  are  without adequate protection in place to prevent illegal access.205 Analysis carried out by the University of  Maryland  suggests  that  an  unprotected  computer  system  that  is  connected  to  the  Internet  is  likely  to  experience attack within less than a minute.206 The installation of protective measures can lower the risk,  but successful attacks against well-protected computer systems prove that technical protection measures  can never completely stop attacks.207    Development of software tools that automate the attacks  Recently,  software  tools  are  being  used  to  automate  attacks.208 With  the  help  of  software  and  pre- installed attacks, a single offender can attack thousands of computer systems in a single day using one  computer.209 If  the  offender  has  access  to  more  computers  –  e.g.
Users that update their operating systems and software applications on a regular  basis  reduce  their  risk  of  falling  victim  to  these  broad-based  attacks,  as  the  companies  developing  protection software analyse attack tools and prepare for the standardized hacking attacks.
Tools  enabling these standardized attacks are widely available over the Internet211 – some for free, but efficient  tools can easily cost several thousand US dollars.212 One example is a hacking tool that allows the offender  to  define  a  range  of  IP-addresses  (e.g.
The  software  allows  for  the  scanning for unprotected ports of all computers using one of the defined IP-addresses.213    The growing role of private computers as a target of hacking attacks  Access to a computer system is often not the primary motivation of an attack.214 Since business computers  are generally better protected than private computers, attacks on business computers are more difficult      17   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     to carry out using pre-configured software tools.215 Over the past few years, offenders have focused their  attacks  increasingly  on  private  computers,  since  many  private  computers  are  inadequately  protected.
Further, private computers often contain sensitive information (e.g.
Offenders are also targeting private computers because, after a successful attack, offenders can include  the computer in their botnet and use the computer for further criminal activities.216  Illegal  access  to  a  computer  system  may  be  viewed  as  analogous  to  illegal  access  to  a  building  and  is  recognized  as  a  criminal  offence  in  many  countries.
217  Analysis  of  different  approaches  to  the  criminalization  of  computer  access  shows  that  enacted  provisions  in  some  cases  confuse  illegal  access  with  subsequent  offences  or  attempt  to  limit  criminalization  of  illegal  access  to  grave  violations  only.
Some provisions criminalize the initial access, while other approaches limit the criminal offence only to  those  cases  where  the  accessed  system  is  protected  by  security  measures218 or  the  perpetrator  has  harmful intentions219 or data was obtained, modified or damaged.
Other legal systems do not criminalize  mere access, but focus on subsequent offences.220   Illegal data acquisition (data espionage)   2.5.2  Sensitive information is often stored in computer systems.
If the computer system is connected to the  Internet,  offenders  can  try  to  access  this  information  via  the  Internet  from  almost  any  place  in  the  world.221 The  Internet  is  increasingly  used  to  obtain  trade  secrets.222 The  value  of  sensitive  information  and the ability to access it remotely makes data espionage highly interesting.
In the 1980s, a number of  German hackers succeeded in entering US government and military computer systems, obtaining secret  information and selling this information to agents from a different country.223  Offenders  use  various  techniques  to  access  victims’  computers,224 including  software  to  scan  for  unprotected  ports 225 or  circumvent  protection  measures,226 as  well  as  “social  engineering”.227 The  last  approach  especially,  which  refers  to  a  non-technical  kind  of  intrusion  that  relies  heavily  on  human  interaction  and  often  involves  tricking  other  people  into  breaking  normal  security  procedures,  is  interesting  as  it  not  based  on  technical  means.228 In  the  context  of  illegal  access  it  describes  the  manipulation  of  human  beings  with  the  intention  of  gaining  access  to  computer  systems.229 Social  engineering is usually very successful, because the weakest link in computer security is often the users  operating  the  computer  system.
One  example  is  “phishing”,  which  has  recently  become  a  key  crime  committed in cyberspace230 and describes attempts to fraudulently acquire sensitive information (such as  passwords) by masquerading as a trustworthy person or business (e.g.
As  a  consequence, user education should be an essential part of any anti-cybercrime strategy.231 In addition,  technical  measures  can  be  taken  to  prevent  illegal  access.
OECD  highlights  the  importance  of  cryptography for users, as cryptography can help improve data protection.232 If the person or organization  storing information uses proper protection measures, cryptographic protection can be more efficient than  any physical protection.233 The success of offenders in obtaining sensitive information is often due to the  absence  of  protection  measures.
Since  important  information  is  increasingly  being  stored  in  computer  systems,  it  is  essential  to  evaluate  whether  the  technical  protection  measures  taken  by  the  users  are  adequate, or if law-makers need to establish additional protection by criminalizing data espionage.234   Although offenders usually target business secrets, data stored on private computers are also increasingly  targeted.235 Private  users  often  store  bank-account  and  credit-card  information  on  their  computer.236  Offenders  can  use  this  information  for  their  own  purposes  (e.g.
bank-account  details  to  make  money  transfers)  or  sell  it  to  a  third  party.237 Credit-card  records  are  for  example  sold  for  up  to  USD  60.238  Hackers’  focus  on  private  computers  is  interesting,  as  the  profits  from  business  secrets  are  generally  higher than the profits to be made from obtaining or selling single credit-card information.
18   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     There  are  two  approaches  to  obtaining  information.
Offenders  can  access  a  computer  system  or  data  storage  device  and  extract  information;  or  try  to  manipulate  the  user  to  make  them  disclose  the  information or access codes that enable offenders to access information (“phishing”).
Offenders often use computer tools installed on victims’ computers or malicious software called spyware  to transmit data to them.239 Various types of spyware have been discovered over recent years, such as  keyloggers.240 Keyloggers are software tools that record every keystroke typed on an infected computer’s  keyboard.241 Some keyloggers send all recorded information to the offender, as soon as the computer is  connected to the Internet.
Similar devices are also  available  as  hardware  devices  that  are  plugged  in  between  the  keyboard  and  the  computer  system  to  record keystrokes on the keyboard.
Hardware-based keyloggers are more difficult to install and detect, as  they  require  physical  access  to  the  computer  system.243 However,  classical  anti-spyware  and  anti-virus  software is largely unable to identify them.244  Apart  from  accessing  computer  systems,  offenders  can  also  obtain  data  by  manipulating  the  user.
Recently,  offenders  have  developed  effective  scams  to  obtain  secret  information  (e.g.
bank-account  information and credit-card data) by manipulating users using social engineering techniques.245 “Phishing”  has recently become one of the most important crimes related to cyberspace.246 The term “phishing” is  used  to  describe  a  type  of  crime  that  is  characterized  by  attempts  to  fraudulently  acquire  sensitive  information,  such  as  passwords,  by  masquerading  as  a  trustworthy  person  or  business  (e.g.
financial  institution) in an apparently official electronic communication.247    Illegal interception   2.5.3  Offenders  can  intercept  communications  between  users248 (such  as  e-mails)  or  other  forms  of  data  transfers  (when  users  upload  data  onto  webservers  or  access  web-based  external  storage  media249)  in  order  to  record  the  information  exchanged.
fixed  lines  or  wireless)  and  any  Internet  service  (e.g.
Most  data-transfer  processes  among  Internet  infrastructure  providers  or  Internet  service  providers  are  well  protected  and  difficult  to  intercept.251 However,  offenders  search  for  weak  points  in  the  system.
Wireless  technologies  are  enjoying  greater  popularity  and  have  in  the  past  proved  vulnerable.252  Nowadays, hotels, restaurants and bars offer customers Internet access through wireless access points.
However, the signals in the data exchanges between the computer and the access point can be received  within a radius of up to 100 metres.253 Offenders who wish to intercept a data-exchange process can do  so  from  any  location  within  this  radius.
Even  where wireless  communications  are  encrypted,  offenders  may be able to decrypt the recorded data.254   To  gain  access  to  sensitive  information,  some  offenders  set  up  access  points  close  to  locations  where  there  is  a  high  demand  for  wireless  access255 (e.g.
The  station  location  is  often  named  in  such  a  way  that  users  searching  for  an  Internet  access  point  are  more  likely  to  choose  the  fraudulent access point.
If users rely on the access provider to ensure the security of their communication  without implementing their own security measures, offenders can easily intercept communications.
However,  given  the  growing  popularity  of  IP-based  services,  law- makers may need to evaluate to what extent similar protection is offered to IP-based services.260       19   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response   Data interference     2.5.4  Computer  data  are  vital  for  private  users,  businesses  and  administrations,  all  of  which  depend  on  the  integrity and availability of data.261 Lack of access to data can result in considerable (financial) damage.
Offenders can violate the integrity of data and interfere with them by deleting, suppressing or altering  computer  data.262 One  common  example  of  the  deletion  of  data  is  the  computer  virus.263 Ever  since  computer technology was first developed, computer viruses have threatened users who failed to install  proper protection.264 Since then, the number of computer viruses has risen significantly.265 Not only has  the number of virus attacks increased, but also the techniques and functions of viruses (payload266) have  changed.
Previously, computer viruses were distributed through storage devices such as floppy disks, whilst today  most  viruses  are  distributed  via  the  Internet  as  attachments  either  to  e-mails  or  to  files  that  users  download.267 These efficient new methods of distribution have massively accelerated virus infection and  vastly  increased  the  number  of  infected  computer  systems.
The  computer  worm  SQL  Slammer268 was  estimated to have infected 90 per cent of vulnerable computer systems within the first 10 minutes of its  distribution.269 The financial damage caused by virus attacks in 2000 alone was estimated to amount to  some USD 17 billion.270 In 2003, it was still more than USD 12 billion.271   Most  first-generation  computer  viruses  either  deleted  information  or  displayed  messages.
Recently,  payloads  have  diversified.272 Modern  viruses  are  able  to  install  back-doors  enabling  offenders  to  take  remote control of the victim’s computer or encrypt files so that victims are denied access to their own  files, until they pay money to receive the key.273    System interference   2.5.5  The same concerns over attacks against computer data apply to attacks against computer systems.
More  businesses are incorporating Internet services into their production processes, with benefits of 24-hour  availability  and  worldwide  accessibility.274 If  offenders  succeed  in  preventing  computer  systems  from  operating smoothly, this can result in great financial losses for victims.275   Attacks can be carried out by physical attacks on the computer system.276 If offenders are able to access  the computer system, they can destroy hardware.
Examples  of  these  remote  attacks  against  computer systems include computer worms278 and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.279  Computer  worms280 are  a  subgroup  of  malware  (like  computer  viruses).
They  are  self-replicating  computer  programs  that  harm  the  network  by  initiating  multiple  data-transfer  processes.
They  can  influence  computer  systems  by  hindering  the  smooth  running  of  the  computer  system,  using  system  resources  to  replicate  themselves  over  the  Internet  or  generating  network  traffic  that  can  close  down  availability of certain services (such as websites).
While  computer  worms  generally  influence  the  whole  network  without  targeting  specific  computer  systems,  DoS  attacks  target  specific  computer  systems.
A  DoS  attack  makes  computer  resources  unavailable  to  their  intended  users.281 By  targeting  a  computer  system  with  more  requests  than  the  computer system can handle, offenders can prevent users from accessing the computer system, checking  e-mails, reading the news, booking a flight or downloading files.

This category covers content that is considered illegal, including child pornography, xenophobic material  or insults related to religious symbols.286 The development of legal instruments to deal with this category  is far more influenced by national approaches, which can take into account fundamental cultural and legal  principles.
The  right  to  freedom  of  expression  is  for  example  defined  by  principle  1  (b)  of  the  Johannesburg  Principles  on  National  Security  and  Freedom  of  Expression.291 However,  principle  1  (c)  clarifies that the right to freedom of expression may be subject to restrictions.
Such limitations are especially  discussed with regard to the criminalization of defamation.292 The 2008 Joint Declaration of the UN Special  Rapporteur  on  Freedom  of  Opinion  and  Expression  and  others  points  out  that  vague  notions  such  as  providing  communications  and  the  glorification  or  promotion  of  terrorism  or  extremism  should  not  be  criminalized.293  These legal challenges are complex, as information made available by one computer user in one country  can be accessed from nearly anywhere in the world.294 If “offenders” create content that is illegal in some  countries, but not in the country they are operating from, prosecution of the “offenders” is difficult, or  impossible.295   There  is  much  lack  of  agreement  regarding  the  content  of  material  and  to  what  degree  specific  acts  should be criminalized.
The different national views and difficulties in prosecuting violations committed  outside  the  territory  of  an  investigating  country  have  contributed  to  the  blocking  of  certain  types  of  content on the Internet.
Where agreement exists on preventing access to websites with illegal content  hosted outside the country, states can maintain strict laws, block websites and filter content.296   There are various approaches to filter systems.
One solution requires access providers to install programs  analysing  the  websites  being  visited  and  to  block  websites  on  a  blacklist.297 Another  solution  is  the  installation of filter software on users’ computers (a useful approach for parents who wish to control the  content their children can view, as well as for libraries and public Internet terminals).298      21   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Attempts to control content on the Internet are not limited to certain types of content that are widely  accepted  to  be  illegal.
Some  countries  use  filter  technology  to  restrict  access  to  websites  addressing  political  topics.
OpenNet  Initiative299 reports  that  censorship  is  currently  practised  by  about  two  dozen  countries.300   Erotic or pornographic material (excluding child pornography)   2.6.1  Sexually-related content was among the first content to be commercially distributed over the Internet,  which offers advantages to retailers of erotic and pornographic material including:   •  exchange of media (such as pictures, movies, live coverage) without the need for cost-intensive   shipping;301   •  worldwide302 access, reaching a significantly larger number of customers than retail shops;   •   the  Internet  is  often  viewed  as  an  anonymous  medium  (often  erroneously303)  –  an  aspect that  consumers of pornography appreciate, in view of prevailing social opinions.
Recent research has identified as many as 4.2 million pornographic websites that may be available on the  Internet at any time.304 Besides websites, pornographic material can be distributed through file-sharing  systems305 and instant messaging systems.
Some  countries  permit  the  exchange  of  pornographic  material  among  adults  and  limit  criminalization  to  cases  where  minors access this kind of material,306 seeking to protect minors.307 Studies indicate that child access to  pornographic material could negatively influence their development.308 To comply with these laws, “adult  verification systems” have been developed.309 Other countries criminalize any exchange of pornographic  material even among adults,310 without focusing on specific groups (such as minors).
For countries that criminalize interaction with pornographic material, preventing access to pornographic  material  is  a  challenge.
Beyond  the  Internet,  authorities  can  in  many  instances  detect  and  prosecute  violations of the prohibition of pornographic material.
On the Internet, however, as pornographic material  is often readily available on servers outside the country, enforcement is difficult.
311 Even  when  authorities seek the support of countries where offensive websites are hosted, successful investigation  and criminal sanctions may be hindered by the principle of “dual criminality”.312   To prevent access to pornographic content, countries with exceptionally strict laws are often limited to  prevention (such as filter technology313) to limit access to certain websites.314    Child pornography   2.6.2  The  Internet  has  become  a  prime  channel  for  the  distribution  of  child  pornography.
In the past, producers did not  have  the  capability  to  develop  photography  and  films.318 They  were  dependent  on  services  offered  by  businesses,  which  increased  the  chances  of  law-enforcement  agents  identifying  child  pornography  through reports from businesses handling the development.319 The availability of video cameras changed  this situation for the first time.320 But the risks were not only related to production.
Getting access to child  pornography  was  similarly  fraught  with  risks  for  the  offender.
While in the past, law enforcement was confronted with analogue material, today the vast majority of  discovered material is digital.325 Since the mid-1990s, offenders have increasingly used network services  for  the  distribution  of  such  material.326 The  resulting  problems  in  terms  of  detecting  and  investigating  child-pornography cases have been acknowledged.327 The Internet is today the main channel for trading  regular pornography328 as well as child pornography.329   Several reasons for the shift from analogue to digital distribution can be identified.
The Internet gives less  technically skilled users the impression they can act invisibly from others.
If the offender does not employ  anonymous communication technology, this impression is erroneous.
But the fact that using sophisticated  means of anonymous communication can hinder the identification of the offender is a matter of concern  in  respect  of  the  exchange  of  child  pornography  online.330 In  addition,  this  development  has  been  supported by the decreasing price of technical devices and services used for the production and trading of  child  pornography,  such  as  recording  equipment  and  hosting  services.331 Since  websites  and  Internet  services  are  open  to  around  two  billion  Internet  users,  the  number  of  potential  customers  has  also  expanded.332 There are concerns that the fact that access is easier attracts people who would not have  taken the risk of being caught trying to obtain child pornography outside the Internet.333 With the shift  from analogue to digital media, an increasing number of child-pornography images discovered through  investigations were reported.334 Another aspect that probably supported this development is the fact that  digital information can in general be duplicated without a loss of quality.335 While in the past consumers  of child pornography wishing to duplicate and trade the material were hindered by the loss in quality from  reproduction,  today  a  downloaded  file  can  become  the  source  for  further  duplications.
One  of  the  consequences of this development is that, even when the offender who produced the material in the first  place is arrested and his files are confiscated, it becomes difficult to “remove” files once they have been  traded over the Internet.336   In  contrast  to  differing  views  on  adult  pornography,  child  pornography  is  broadly  condemned  and  offences  related  to  child  pornography  are  widely  recognized  as  criminal  acts.
337  International  organizations are engaged in the fight against online child pornography,338 with several international legal  initiatives,  including:  the  1989  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child;339 the  2003  European Union Council Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child  pornography;340 and the 2007 Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual  Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, among others.341   Sadly,  these  initiatives  seeking  to  control  the  network  distribution  of  pornography  have  proved  little  deterrent to perpetrators, who use the Internet to communicate and exchange child pornography.342 An  increase in bandwidth has supported the exchange of movies and picture archives.
Research into the behaviour of child pornography offenders shows that 15 per cent of arrested people  with  Internet-related  child  pornography  in  their  possession  had  more  than  1 000  pictures  on  their  computer; 80 per cent had pictures of children aged between 6 and 12 years on their computer;343 19 per  cent  had  pictures  of  children  younger  than  the  age  of  3344;  and  21  per  cent  had  pictures  depicting  violence.345  The  sale  of  child  pornography  is  highly  profitable,346 with  collectors  willing  to  pay  great  amounts  for  movies and pictures depicting children in a sexual context.347 Search engines find such material quickly.348  Most  material  is  exchanged  in  password-protected  closed  forums,  which  regular  users  and  law- enforcement  agencies  can  rarely  access.
The demand for anonymous payments has led to the development of virtual payment systems  and virtual currencies enabling anonymous payment.351 Virtual currencies may not require identification  and  validation,  preventing  law-enforcement  agencies  from  tracing  money  flows  back  to  offenders.
Law-enforcement agencies note that offenders  are using encryption technology to protect information stored on their hard disks,357 seriously hindering  criminal investigations.358  In addition to a broad criminalization of acts related to child pornography, other approaches such as the  implementation  of  obligations  on  Internet  services  to  register  users  or  to  block  or  filter  the  access  to  websites related to child pornography are currently under discussion.359    Racism, hate speech, glorification of violence   2.6.3  Radical  groups  use  mass  communication  systems  such  as  the  Internet  to  spread  propaganda.360 The  number of websites offering racist content and hate speech has risen in recent years361 – a study in 2005  suggested  a  rise  of  25  per  cent  in  the  number  of  webpages  promoting  racial  hatred,  violence  and  xenophobia between 2004 and 2005.362 In 2006, over 6 000 such websites existed on the Internet.363   Internet  distribution  offers  several  advantages  for  offenders,  including  lower  distribution  costs,  non- specialist equipment and a global audience.
Examples of incitement-to-hatred websites include websites  presenting instructions on how to build bombs.364 Besides propaganda, the Internet is used to sell certain  goods, e.g.
Nazi-related items such as flags with symbols, uniforms and books, readily available on auction  platforms  and  specialized  web-shops.365 The  Internet  is  also  used  to  send  e-mails  and  newsletters  and  distribute video clips and television shows through popular archives such as YouTube.
Not  all  countries  criminalize  these  offences.366 In  some  countries,  such  content  may  be  protected  by  principles of freedom of speech.367 Opinions differ as to how far the principle of freedom of expression  applies with regard to certain topics, often hindering international investigations.
(based  in  the  US)  to  block  the  access  of  French  users  to  Nazi-related  material.368 Based  on  the  First  Amendment of the United States Constitution, the sale of such material is legal under United States law.
The Convention on Cybercrime seeks to harmonize cybercrime-related  laws  to  ensure  that  international  investigations  are  not  hindered  by  conflicts  of  laws.370 Not  all  parties  engaged in negotiations could agree on a common position on the criminalization of the dissemination of  xenophobic material, so this entire topic was excluded from the Convention on Cybercrime and instead  addressed in a separate First Protocol.371 Otherwise, some countries (including the United States) might  have been unable to sign the Convention on Cybercrime.
decreasing  church  attendance  in  Europe),  this  information  may  be   24   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     considered  illegal  in  some  jurisdictions.
Other  examples  include  the  defamation  of  religions  or  the  publication of cartoons.
The Internet offers advantages for those who wish to debate or deal critically with a subject – people can  leave comments, post material or write articles without having to disclose their identity.
Many discussion  groups are based on the principle of freedom of speech.374 Freedom of speech is a key driver behind the  Internet’s success, with portals that are used specifically for user-generated content.375 Whilst it is vital to  protect this principle, even in the most liberal countries the application of principles of freedom of speech  is governed by conditions and laws.
The differing legal standards on illegal content reflect the challenges of regulating content.
Even where  the publication of content is covered by provisions relating to freedom of speech in the country where the  content is available, this material can be accessed from countries with stricter regulations.
The publication of twelve editorial cartoons in  the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten led to widespread protests across the Muslim world.376  As  with  illegal  content,  the  availability  of  certain  information  or  material  is  a  criminal  offence  in  some  countries.
Illegal gambling and online games   2.6.5  Internet  games  and  gambling  are  one  of  the  fastest-growing  areas  in  the  Internet.379 Linden  Labs,  the  developer  of  the  online  game  Second  Life,380 reports  that  some  ten  million  accounts  have  been  registered.381 Reports  show  that  some  such  games  have  been  used  to  commit  crimes,  including382 the  exchange and presentation of child pornography,383 fraud,384 gambling in virtual online casinos385 and libel  (e.g.
Some  estimates  project  growth  in  estimated  online  gambling  revenues  from  USD 3.1 billion  in  2001  to  USD 24 billion  in  2010  for  Internet  gambling386 (although  compared  with  revenues  from  traditional  gambling, these estimates are still relatively small387).
The regulation of gambling over and outside the Internet varies between countries388 – a loophole that  has  been  exploited  by  offenders,  as  well  as  legal  businesses  and  casinos.
The  Internet  allows  people  to  circumvent  gambling  restrictions.391 Online  casinos  are  widely  available,  most of them hosted in countries with liberal laws or no regulations on Internet gambling.
It is difficult for countries with gambling restrictions to control the use or activities of online casinos.
The  Internet  is  undermining  some  countries’  legal  restrictions  on  access  by  citizens  to  online  gambling.394  There have been several legislative attempts to prevent participation in online gambling:395 notably, the  US  Internet  Gambling  Prohibition  Enforcement  Act  of  2006  seeks  to  limit  illegal  online  gambling  by  prosecuting financial services providers if they carry out settlement of transactions associated with illegal  gambling.396    Libel and false information   2.6.6  The Internet can be used to spread misinformation, just as easily as information.397 Websites can present      25   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     false  or  defamatory  information,  especially  in  forums  and  chat  rooms,  where  users  can  post  messages  without  verification  by  moderators.398 Minors  are  increasingly  using  web  forums  and  social  networking  sites where such information can be posted as well.399 Criminal behaviour400 can include (for example) the  publication of intimate photographs or false information about sexual behaviours.401  In most cases, offenders take advantage of the fact that providers offering cheap or free publication do  not  usually  require  identification  of  authors  or  may  not  verify  ID.402 This  makes  the  identification  of  offenders  complicated.
These  advantages  have  not  prevented  the  development  of  valuable  projects  such  as  the  online  user-generated  encyclopaedia,  Wikipedia,403 where  strict  procedures  exist  for  the  regulation  of  content.
However,  the  same  technology  can  also  be  used  by  offenders  to  publish  false  information  (e.g.
about competitors)404 or disclose secret information (e.g.
the publication of state secrets or sensitive  business information).
It is vital to highlight the increased danger presented by false or misleading information.
Defamation can  seriously injure the reputation and dignity of victims to a considerable degree, as online statements are  accessible to a worldwide audience.
The moment information is published over the Internet, the author  often  loses  control  of  this  information.
Even  if  the  information  is  corrected  or  deleted  shortly  after  publication,  it  may  already  have  been  duplicated  (“mirroring”)  and  made  available  by  people  that  are  unwilling to rescind or remove it.
In this case, information may still be available on the Internet, even if it  has been removed or corrected by the original source.405 Examples include cases of “runaway e-mails”,  where millions of people can receive salacious, misleading or false e-mails about people or organizations,  where  the  damage  to  reputations  may  never  be  restored,  regardless  of  the  truth  or  otherwise  of  the  original e-mail.
Since  the  first  spam  e-mail was sent in 1978,409 the tide of spam e-mails has increased dramatically.410 Today, e-mail provider  organizations  report that as many as 85 to 90 per cent of all e-mails are spam.411 The main sources of  spam e-mails in 2007 were: the United States (19.6 per cent of the recorded total); People’s Republic of  China (8.4 per cent); and the Republic of Korea (6.5 per cent).412   Most  e-mail  providers  have  reacted  to  rising  levels  of  spam  e-mails  by  installing  anti-spam  filter  technology.
This  technology  identifies  spam  using  keyword  filters  or  blacklists  of  spammers’  IP  addresses.413 Although filter technology continues to develop, spammers find ways around these systems  – for example, by avoiding keywords.
This  makes  it  more  difficult  for  e-mail  providers  to  identify  spam  by  analysing  the  information about senders and more difficult for law-enforcement agencies to track offenders.
A Dutch spammer reported a profit of around USD 50 000 by sending out  at least 9 billion spam e-mails.421    26   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     In  2005,  the  OECD  published  a  report  analysing  the  impact  of  spam  on  developing  countries.422  Developing countries often express the view that Internet users in their countries suffer more from the  impact of spam and Internet abuse.
Spam is a serious issue in developing countries, where bandwidth and  Internet  access  are  scarcer  and  more  expensive  than  in  industrialized  countries.423 Spam  consumes  valuable time and resources in countries where Internet resources are rarer and more costly.
2.6.8  Other forms of illegal content  The Internet is not only used for direct attacks, but also as a forum for soliciting, offers and incitement to  commit  crimes424 unlawful  sale  of  products  and  providing  information  and  instructions  for  illegal  acts  (e.g.
Different countries apply  different national regulations and trade restrictions to various products such as military equipment.425 A  similar situation exists for medicines – medicines which are available without restriction in some countries  may  need  prescription  in  others.426 Cross-border  trade  may  make  it  difficult  to  ensure  that  access  to  certain products is restricted within a territory.427 Given the popularity of the Internet, this problem has  grown.
Prior to the Internet, it was difficult for most people to access instructions on how to build weapons.
The  necessary information was available (e.g.
Today,  information  on  how  to  build  explosives  is  available  over  the  Internet428 and  ease of access to information increases the likelihood of attacks.

One of the vital functions of the Internet is the dissemination of information.
Companies use the Internet  to distribute information about their products and services.
In terms of piracy, successful companies may  face problems on the Internet comparable to those that exist outside the network.
Management:   The   Skeptics’   View,      27   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response   Copyright-related offences     2.7.1  With the switch from analogue to digital,430 digitization431 has enabled the entertainment industry to add  additional  features  and  services  to  movies  on  DVD,  including  languages,  subtitles,  trailers  and  bonus  material.
The most common copyright violations include the exchange of  copyright-protected songs, files and software in file-sharing systems433 or through sharehosting services  and the circumvention of digital rights management (DRM) systems.434  File-sharing systems are peer-to-peer435-based network services that enable users to share files,436 often  with millions of other users.437 After installing file-sharing software, users can select files to share and use  software  to  search  for  other  files  made  available  by  others  for  download  from  hundreds  of  sources.
Before file-sharing systems were developed, people copied records and tapes and exchanged them, but  file-sharing systems permit the exchange of copies by many more users.
Peer-to-peer (P2P) technology plays a vital role in the Internet.
In 2007, over 50 per cent of consumer  Internet traffic was generated by P2P networks.438 The number of users is growing all the time – a report  published by the OECD estimates that some 30 per cent of French Internet users have downloaded music  or  files  in  file-sharing  systems,439 with  other  OECD  countries  showing  similar  trends.440 File-sharing  systems can be used to exchange any kind of computer data, including music, movies and software.441  Historically, file-sharing systems have been used mainly to exchange music, but the exchange of videos is  becoming more and more important.442   The technology used for file-sharing services is highly sophisticated and enables the exchange of large files  in short periods of time.443 First-generation file-sharing systems depended on a central server, enabling  law-enforcement  agencies  to  act  against  illegal  file-sharing  in  the  Napster  network.444 Unlike  first- generation  systems  (especially  the  famous  Napster  service),  second-generation  file-sharing  systems  are  no longer based on a central server providing a list of files available between users.445 The decentralized  concept  of  second-generation  file-sharing  networks  makes  it  more  difficult  to  prevent  them  from  operating.
However, due to direct communications, it is possible to trace users of a network by their IP- address.446 Law-enforcement  agencies  have  had  some  success  investigating  copyright  violations  in  file- sharing systems.
More recent versions of file-sharing systems enable forms of anonymous communication  and will make investigations more difficult.447  File-sharing  technology  is  not  only  used  by  ordinary  people  and  criminals,  but  also  by  regular  businesses.448 Not all files exchanged in file-sharing systems violate copyrights.
Examples of its legitimate  use include the exchange of authorized copies or artwork within the public domain.449  Nevertheless,  the  use  of  file-sharing  systems  poses  challenges  for  the  entertainment  industry.450 It  is  unclear to what extent falls in sales of CD/DVDs and cinema tickets are due to the exchange of titles in  file-sharing  systems.
The recent development of anonymous file-sharing systems  will make the work of copyright-holders more difficult, as well as that of law-enforcement agencies.454   The entertainment industry has responded by implementing technology designed to prevent users from  making  copies  of  CDs  and  DVDs  such  as  content  scrambling  systems  (CSS),455 an  encryption  technology  preventing  content  on  DVDs  from  being  copied.456 This  technology  is  a  vital  element  of  new  business  models  seeking  to  assign  access  rights  to  users  more  precisely.
Digital  rights  management  (DRM)457  describes  the  implementation  of  technologies  allowing  copyright-holders  to  restrict  the  use  of  digital  media,  where  customers  buy  limited  rights  only  (e.g.
DRM  offers  the  possibility  of  implementing  new  business  models  that  reflect  copyright-holders’  and  users’  interests more accurately and could reverse declines in profits.
28   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     One  of  the  biggest  difficulties  with  these  technologies  is  that  copyright-protection  technology  can  be  circumvented.458 Offenders have developed software tools that enable the users to make copy-protected  files available over the Internet459 free of charge or at low prices.
Although protection technologies are advanced, offenders have succeeded in falsifying the hardware used  as access control or have broken the encryption using software tools.460  Without  software  tools,  regular  users  are  less  able  to  commit  such  offences.
Discussions  on  the  criminalization  of  copyright  violations  not  only  focus  on  file-sharing  systems  and  the  circumvention  of  technical protection, but also on the production, sale and possession of “illegal devices” or tools that are  designed to enable the users to carry out copyright violations.461    Trademark-related offences   2.7.2  Trademark violations, a well-known aspect of global trade, are similar to copyright violations.
Violations  related  to  trademarks  have  transferred  to  cyberspace,  with  varying  degrees  of  criminalization  under  different  national  penal  codes.462 The  most  serious  offences  include  the  use  of  trademarks  in  criminal  activities with the aim of misleading users and domain name related offences.
Offenders use brand names  and trademarks fraudulently in a number of activities, including phishing,463 where millions of e-mails are  sent out to Internet users resembling e-mails from legitimate companies, e.g.
including trademarks.464  A  further  issue  related  to  trademark  violations  is  domain-related  offences465 such  as  cybersquatting,466  which describes the illegal process of registering a domain name identical or similar to a trademark of a  product  or  a  company.467 In  most  cases,  offenders  seek  to  sell  the  domain  for  a  high  price  to  the  company468 or to use it to sell products or services misleading users through their supposed connection to  the trademark.
469 Another example of a domain-related offence is “domain hijacking” or the registration  of domain names that have accidentally lapsed.470    A   Hopeful   Future   available   Frustrating   Present,   but   a   Fundamentals,  Part   Computer-related offences   2.8  Bibliography  (selected):  Bywell/Oppenheim,  Fraud  on  Internet  Auctions,  Aslib  Proceedings,  53  (7),  page 265 et seq.

With a “small” loss, victims  are less likely to invest time and energy in reporting and investigating such crimes.474 One example of such  a scam is the Nigeria Advanced Fee Fraud.475  Although these offences are carried out using computer technology, most criminal law systems categorize  them not as computer-related offences, but as regular fraud.476 The main distinction between computer- related and traditional fraud is the target of the fraud.
Those criminal law systems that cover fraud, but do not yet  include  the  manipulation  of  computer  systems  for  fraudulent  purposes,  can  often  still  prosecute  the  above-mentioned offences.
The most common fraud offences include online auction fraud and advanced  fee fraud.
In 2006, goods worth more than  USD 20 billion  were  sold  on  eBay,  the  world’s  largest  online  auction  marketplace.478 Buyers  can  access  varied or specialist niche goods from around the world.
In  response,  auction  providers  have  developed  protection  systems  such  as  the  feedback/comments  system.
After  each  transaction,  buyer  and  sellers  leave  feedback  for  use  by  other  users483 as  neutral  information about the reliability of sellers/buyers.
If  they  send  their  bank  account  information,  offenders  may  use  this  information  for  fraudulent  activities.
Evidence  suggests  that  thousands  of  targets  reply  to  e-mails.488 Current  researches  show  that,  despite  various  information  campaigns and initiatives, advance fee frauds are still growing – in terms of both the number of victims  and total losses.489    Computer-related forgery   2.8.2  Computer-related  forgery  describes  the  manipulation  of  digital  documents.490 The  offence  can  for  example  be  committed  by  creating  a  document  that  appears  to  originate  from  a  reliable  institution,   30   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     manipulating  electronic  images  (for  example,  pictures  used  as  evidence  in  court)  or  altering  text  documents.
491  “Phishing”  seeks  to  make  targets  disclose  personal/secret  information.492 Often, offenders send out e-mails that look like communications from legitimate financial  institutions used by the target.493 The e-mails are designed in a way that it is difficult for targets to identify  them as fake e-mails.494 The e-mail asks recipient to disclose and/or verify certain sensitive information.
Many  victims  follow  the  advice  and  disclose  information  enabling  offenders  to  make  online  transfers  etc.495   In  the  past, prosecutions  involving  computer-related  forgery  were  rare,  because most  legal  documents  were tangible documents.
For forensic experts, it is difficult to prove  digital manipulations, unless technical protection496 is used to protect a document from being falsified.497   Identity theft   2.8.3  The  term  identity  theft  –  which  is  neither  consistently  defined  nor  consistently  used  –  describes  the  criminal act of fraudulently obtaining and using another person’s identity.498 These acts can be carried out  without the help of technical means499 as well as online by using Internet technology.500   Wide media coverage,501 the results of various surveys analysing the extent of and loss caused by identity  theft,502 as well as numerous legal and technical analyses503 published in recent years could easily lead to  the conclusion, that identity-related offences are a 21st-century phenomenon.504 But this is not the case,  as offences related to impersonation and the falsification and misuse of identity documents have existed  for  more  than  a  century.505 Already  back in  the  1980s, the  press  intensively  reported  on  the  misuse  of  identity-related  information.506 The  emerging  use  of  digital  identities  and  information  technology  only  changed the methods and targets of the offenders.507 Increasing use of digital information opened up new  possibilities  for  offenders  to  gain  access  to  identity-related  information.508 Thus,  the  transformation  process from industrialized nations to information societies509 has had a big influence on the development  of identity-theft offences.
Nonetheless, despite the large number of Internet-related identity-theft cases,  digitization  did  not  fundamentally  change  the  offence  itself,  but  merely  created  new  targets  and  facilitated the development of new methods.510 The impact of the increasing use of Internet technology  seems  to  be  overestimated.
Based  on  the  results  of  a  method  analysis  of  identity-related  offences,  identity theft to a large degree remains an offline crime.511 Less than 20 per cent of the offences in the US  in  2007512 were  online  scams  and  data  breaches.513 The  persisting  importance  of  offline  crimes  is  surprising, insofar as the digitization and moreover the globalization of network-based services has led to  increasing  use  of  digital  identity-related  information.
514 Identity-related  information  is  of  growing  importance, both in the economy and in social interaction.
In the past, a “good name” and good personal  relations dominated business as well as daily transactions.515 With the transfer to electronic commerce,  face-to-face  identification  is  hardly  possible,  and  as  a  consequence  identity-related  information  has  become much more important for people participating in social and economic interaction.516 This process  can  be  described  as  instrumentalization,517 whereby  an  identity  is  translated  into  quantifiable  identity- related information.
This process, along with the distinction between the more philosophical aspect of the  term  “identity”  (defined518 as  the  collection  of  personal  characteristics)  and  the  quantifiable  identity- related information that enables the recognition of a person, is of great importance.
The transformation  process is not just relevant to Internet-related features of identity theft, as the impact of the development  goes far beyond computer networks.
Nowadays, the requirements of non face-to-face transactions, such  as  trust  and  security,519 dominate  the  economy  in  general  and  not  just  e-commerce  businesses.
31   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     In general, the offence described as identity theft contains three different phases.520 In the first phase the  offender obtains identity-related information.
The  second  phase  is  characterized  by  interaction  with  identity-related information prior to the use of the information within criminal offences.521 An example is  the sale of identity-related information.522 Credit-card records are for example sold for up to USD 60.523  The third phase is the use of the identity-related information in relation with a criminal offence.
In most  cases,  the  access  to  identity-related  data  enables  the  perpetrator  to  commit  further  crimes.524 The  perpetrators are therefore not focusing on the set of data itself but the ability to use the data in criminal  activities.
The offender can use physical  methods,  for  example  stealing  computer  storage  devices  with  identity-related  data,  searching  trash  (“dumpster  diving”526)  or  mail  theft.527 In  addition,  they  can  use  search  engines  to  find  identity-related  data.
“Googlehacking”  or  “Googledorks”  are  terms  that  describe  the  use  of  complex  search-engine  queries  to  filter  through  large  amounts  of  search  results  for  information  related  to  computer  security  issues as well as personal information that can be used in identity-theft scams.
The United States Congress discussed  recently  the  possibilities  of  exploiting  file-sharing  systems  to  obtain  personal  information  that  can  be  abused for identity theft.530 Apart from that, the offenders can make use of insiders, who have access to  stored  identity-related  information,  to  obtain  that  information.
The  2007  CSI  Computer  Crime  and  Security Survey531 shows that more than 35 per cent of the respondents attribute a percentage of their  organization’s  losses  greater  than  20  per  cent  to  insiders.
Finally  the  perpetrators  can  use  social  engineering  techniques  to  persuade  the  victim  to  disclose  personal  information.
In  recent  years  perpetrators have developed effective scams to obtain secret information (e.g.
bank-account information  and credit-card data) by manipulating users through social engineering techniques.532  The type of data the perpetrators target varies.533 The most relevant data are social security and passport  numbers, date of birth, address and phone numbers, and passwords.
Social security number (SSN) or passport number   The SSN used, for example, in the United States is a classic example of a single identity-related data item  that  perpetrators  target.
Although  the  SSN  was  created  to  keep  an  accurate  record  of  earnings,  it  is  currently  widely  used  for  identification  purposes.534 The  perpetrators  can  use  the  SSN  and  passport  information to open financial accounts, to take over existing financial accounts, to obtain credit or run up  debt.535   Date of birth, address and phone numbers  Such data can in general only be used to commit identity theft if they are combined with other pieces of  information (e.g.
the SSN).536 Having access to additional information like date of birth and address can  help  the  perpetrator  to  circumvent  verification  processes.
One  of  the  greatest  dangers  related  to  that  information  is  the  fact  that  it  is  currently  available  on  a  large  scale  on  the  Internet  –  either  published  voluntarily  in  one  of  the  various  identity-related  fora537 or  based  on  legal  requirements  as  imprint  on  websites.538   Password for non-financial accounts   Having access to passwords for accounts allows perpetrators to change the settings of the account and  use it for their own purposes.539 They can for example take over an e-mail account and use it to send out  mails with illegal content or take over the account of a user of an auction platform and use the account to  sell stolen goods.540   32   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Password for financial accounts   Like the SSN, information regarding financial accounts is a popular target for identity theft.
This includes  cheque  and  saving  accounts,  credit  cards,  debit  cards,  and  financial  planning  information.
Such  information is an important source for an identity thief to commit financial cybercrimes.
Identity theft is a serious and growing problem.541 In the first half of 2004, 3 per cent of United States  households fell victim to identity theft.542 In the United Kingdom, the cost of identity theft to the British  economy has been calculated at GBP 1.3 billion every year.543 Estimates of losses caused by identity theft  in Australia vary from less than USD 1 billion to more than USD 3 billion per year.544 The 2006 Identity  Fraud Survey estimates the losses in the United States at USD 56.6 billion in 2005.545 Losses may be not  only financial, but may also include damage to reputations.546 In reality, many victims do not report such  crimes, while financial institutions often do not wish to publicize customers’ bad experiences.
The actual  incidence of identity theft is likely to far exceed the number of reported losses.547   Identity theft is based on the fact that there are few instruments to verify the identity of users over the  Internet.
using biometric information) are costly and not  widely used.
There are few limits on online activities, making identity theft easy and profitable.548    2.8.4  Misuse of devices  Cybercrime can be committed using only fairly basic equipment.549 Committing offences such as libel or  online  fraud  needs  nothing  more  than  a  computer  and  Internet  access  and  can  be  carried  out  from  a  public Internet café.
Standard attacks are now less efficient, as  protection  software  companies  analyse  the  tools  currently  available  and  prepare  for  standard  hacking  attacks.
High-profile  attacks  are  often  individually  designed  for  specific  targets.552 Software  tools553 are  available that enable the offender to carry out DoS attacks554, design computer viruses, decrypt encrypted  communication or illegally access computer systems.
Different national and international legislative  initiatives  are  being  undertaken  to  address  such  software  tools  –  for  example,  by  criminalizing  their  production, sale or possession.556    Islamic   and   the   Caliphate:   extremists   Combination offences   2.9  Bibliography (selected): Arquilla/Ronfeldt, in The Future of Terror, Crime and Militancy, 2001; Brandon,  Virtual  at:  www.socialcohesion.co.uk/pdf/VirtualCaliphateExecutiveSummary.pdf;  Conway,  Terrorist  Use  of  the  Internet and Fighting Back, Information and Security, 2006; Crilley, Information warfare: New Battlefields  –  Terrorists,  propaganda  and  the  Internet,  Aslib  Proceedings,  Vol.

Examples include terrorist use of the Internet, cyberlaundering and phishing.
International   Terrorist use of the Internet    2.9.1  In  the  1990s,  discussion  about  the  use  of  the  network  by  terrorist  organizations  focused  on  network- based attacks against critical infrastructure such as transportation and energy supply (“cyberterrorism”)  and  the  use  of  information  technology  in  armed  conflicts  (“cyberwarfare”).557 The  success  of  virus  and  botnet  attacks  has  clearly  demonstrated  weaknesses  in  network  security.
At least in the past, therefore, falling trees posed a greater risk for energy  supply than successful hacking attacks.560   This situation changed after the 9/11 attacks, which prompted the start of an intensive discussion about  the  use  of  ICTs  by  terrorists.561 This  discussion  was  facilitated  by  reports562 that  the  offenders  used  the  Internet in their preparation of the attack.563 Although the attacks were not cyberattacks, insofar as the  group that carried out the 9/11 attack did not carry out an Internet-based attack, the Internet played a  role in the preparation of the offence.564 In this context, different ways in which terrorist organizations use  the Internet were discovered.565 Today, it is known that terrorists use ICTs and the Internet for:    information gathering   •  propaganda  •  •  preparation of real-world attacks  •  publication of training material  •  •  •  attacks against critical infrastructures.
The vulnerability of and the growing reliance566 on  information  technology  makes  Internet-related  attacks  against  critical  infrastructure in strategies to prevent and fight cyberterrorism.
A  comparison of the different national approaches shows many similarities in the strategies.567 One of the  reasons for this development is the fact that the international communities recognized that the threats of  international  terrorism  require  global  solutions.568 But  it  is  currently  uncertain  if  this  approach  is   it  necessary  to   include   34   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     successful or if the different legal systems and different cultural backgrounds require different solutions.
The same difficulties arise with  regard to the determination of the level of threat related to the use of information technology by terrorist  organizations.
This  information  is  very  often  classified  and  therefore  only  available  to  the  intelligence  sector.569 Not even a consensus on the term “terrorism” has yet been achieved.570 A CRS report for the  United States Congress for example states that the fact that one terrorist booked a flight ticket to the  United States via the Internet is proof that terrorists used the Internet in preparation of their attacks.571  This seems to be a vague argumentation, as the booking of a flight ticket does not become a terrorist- related activity just because it is carried out by a terrorist.
Propaganda  In 1998, only 12 out of the 30 foreign terrorist organizations that are listed by the United States State  Department maintained websites to inform the public about their activities.572 In 2004, the United States  Institute of Peace reported that nearly all terrorist organizations maintain websites – among them Hamas,  Hezbollah, PKK and Al Qaida.573 Terrorists have also started to use video communities (such as YouTube)  to distribute video messages and propaganda.574 The use of websites and other forums are signs of a more  professional  public  relations  focus  of  subversive  groups.575 Websites  and  other  media  are  used  to  disseminate propaganda,576 to describe and publish justifications577 of their activities and to recruit578 new  and  contact  existing  members  and  donors.579 Websites  have  been  used  recently  to  distribute  videos  of  executions.580   Information gathering  Considerable information about possible targets is available over the Internet.581 For example, architects  involved in the construction of public buildings often publish plans of buildings on their websites.
Today,  high-resolution satellite pictures are available free of change on various Internet services that years ago  were only available to very few military institutions in the world.582.
583 In  addition,  sensitive  or  confidential  information  that  is  not  adequately  protected  from  search  robots  can  be  accessed  via  search  engines.584 In  2003,  the  United  States  Department of Defense was informed that a training manual linked to Al Qaeda contained information  that public sources could be used to find details about potential targets.585 In 2006, the New York Times  reported  that  basic  information  related  to  the  construction  of  nuclear  weapons  were  published  on  a  government website that provided evidence about the Iraq approaches to develop nuclear weapons.
586 A  similar incident was reported in Australia, where detailed information about potential targets for terrorist  attacks  was  available  on  government  websites.
587 In  2005,  the  press  in  Germany  reported  that  investigators found that manuals on how to build explosives were downloaded from the Internet onto the  computer of two suspects that tried to attack public transportation with self-built bombs.588    Preparation of real-world attacks  There are different ways that terrorists can make use of information technology in preparing their attack.
Theoretically, these online games could be used to  simulate  attacks,  but  it  is  not  yet  certain  to  what  extent  online  games  are  already  involved  in  that  activity.590    Publication of training material  The Internet can be used to spread training material such as instructions on how to use weapons and how  to select targets.
Such material is available on a large scale from online sources.591 In 2008, Western secret      35   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     services discovered an Internet server that provided a basis for the exchange of training material as well  as  communication.592 Different  websites  were  reported  to  be  operated  by  terrorist  organizations  to  coordinate activities.593    Communication  The  use  of  information  technology  by  terrorist  organizations  is  not  limited  to  running  websites  and  research in databases.
In the context of the investigations after the 9/11 attacks, it was reported that the  terrorists  used  e-mail  communication  for  coordination  of  their  attacks.594 The  press  reported  on  the  exchange  via e-mail  of  detailed  instructions  about  the  targets  and  the  number of  attackers.595 By  using  encryption technology and means of anonymous communication, the communicating parties can make it  even more difficult to identify and monitor terrorist communication.
Terrorist financing  Most terrorist organizations depend on financial resources they receive from third parties.
One  of  the  main  difficulties  in  this  respect  is  the  fact  that  the  financial  resources  required to carry out attacks are not necessarily large.596 There are several ways in which Internet services  can be used for terrorist financing.
Terrorist organizations can make use of electronic payment systems to  enable online donations.597 They can use websites to publish information how to donate, e.g.
An  example  of  such  an  approach  is  the  organization  “Hizb al-Tahrir”, which published bank-account information for potential donors.598 Another approach is  the implementation of online credit-card donations.
The Irish Republican Army (IRA) was one of the first  terrorist organizations that collected donations via credit card.599 Both approaches carry the risk that the  published information will be discovered and used to trace back financial transactions.
To  avoid  discovery,  terrorist  organizations  are  trying  to  hide  their  activities  by  involving  non-suspicious  players  such  as  charity  organizations.
It  is  relatively  simple to set up an online shop on the Internet.
One of the biggest advantages of the network is the fact  that businesses can be operated worldwide.
It would be necessary to investigate every  transaction – which can be difficult if the online shop is operated in a different jurisdiction or anonymous  payment systems are used.600   Attacks against critical infrastructures  In addition to regular computer crimes such as fraud and identity theft, attacks against critical information  infrastructures could become a goal for terrorists.
The growing reliance on information technology makes  critical  infrastructure  more  vulnerable  to  attacks.601 This  is  especially  the  case  with  regard  to  attacks  against  interconnected  systems  that  are  linked  by  computer  and  communication  networks.602 In  those  cases, the disruption caused by a network-based attack goes beyond the failure of a single system.
Even  short interruptions to services could cause huge financial damage to e-commerce businesses – not only  for civil services but also for military infrastructure and services.603 Investigating or even preventing such  attacks presents unique challenges.604 Unlike physical attacks, the offenders do not need to be present at  the place where the effect of the attack occurs.605 And while carrying out the attack the offenders can use  means  of  anonymous  communication  and  encryption  technology  to  conceal  their  identity.
606  As  highlighted  above,  investigating  such  attacks  requires  special  procedural  instruments,  investigation  technology and trained personnel.607   Critical infrastructure is widely recognized as a potential target for terrorist attacks as it is by definition  vital for a state’s sustainability and stability.608 An infrastructure is considered to be critical if its incapacity  or destruction would have a debilitating impact on the defence or economic security of a state.609 These  are  in  particular:  electrical  power  systems,  telecommunication  systems,  gas  and  oil  storage  and  transportation, banking and finance, transportation, water supply systems and emergency services.
The  degree of civil disturbance caused by the disruption of services by Hurricane Katrina in the United States   36   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     highlights  the  dependence  of  society  on  the  availability  of  those  services.610 The  malicious  software  “Stuxnet”  underlines  the  emerging  threat  posed  by  Internet-based  attacks  focusing  on  critical  infrastructure.611 In 2010, a security firm in Belarus discovered a new malicious software.612 Research into  the manipulations caused by the software, the designer and the motivation is still ongoing and by far not  all the facts have been discovered, especially in regard to attribution and motivation of the designer.613  However, especially with regard to the functioning of the software, there seems to be a rather solid fact  basis by now:  The  complex  software,  with  more  than  4 000  functions,614 was  reported  to  target  industrial  control  systems (ICS)615 – in particular those produced by the technology company Siemens.616 It was distributed  through  removable  drives  and  used  four  zero-day  exploits  for  the  infection  of  computer  systems.617  Infected computer systems have mainly been reported from Iran, Indonesia and Pakistan, but also from  the US and European countries.618 Although the malicious software is frequently characterized as highly  sophisticated, there are reports that question the degree of sophistication.619  As indicated above, the determination of attribution and motive is more difficult and still highly uncertain.
First of all, the incident  underlines  that  critical  infrastructure  is  largely  dependent  on  computer  technology  and  attacks  are  possible.
Secondly, the fact that the software was distributed among other methods, through removable  drives highlights that simply disconnecting computer systems from the Internet does not prevent attacks.
The dependence of critical infrastructure on ICT goes beyond the energy and nuclear industry.
Airlines use information technology for various operations.
In 2001 the Lufthansa website was the target of an  attack.627   Finally,  a  further  potential  target  for  Internet-related  attacks  against  critical  air  transportation  infrastructure  is  the  airport  control  system.
The  vulnerability  of  computer-controlled  flight  control  systems was demonstrated by a hacking attack against Worcester Airport in the US in 1997.628 During the  hacking  attack,  the  offender  disabled  phone  services  to  the  airport  tower  and  shut  down  the  control  system managing the runway lights.629    Cyberwarfare   2.9.2  After  the  attacks  against  computer  systems  in  Estonia  in  2007  and  Georgia  in  2008  and  more  recently  after  the  discovery  of  the  “Stuxnet”630 computer  virus,  the  term  cyberwarfare  has  frequently  been  employed to describe the situation although – as described more in detail below – the use of terminology  is problematic.
Other terms  used  are  information  warfare,  electronic  warfare,  cyberwar,  netwar,  information  operations.631 Those  terms are in general employed to describe the utilization of ICTs in conducting warfare using the Internet.
37   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     More  restrictive  definitions  define  such  activities  as  an  approach  to  armed  conflict  focusing  on  the  management  and  use  of  information  in  all  its  forms  and  at  all  levels  to  achieve  a  decisive  military   advantage  especially  in  the  joint  and  combined  environment.632 Other,  broader  definitions  cover  any  electronic conflict in which information is a strategic asset worthy of conquest or destruction.633   Development of the debate  The topic has been a controversial matter of discussion for decades.634 Attention originally focused on the  substitution  of  classic  warfare  by  computer-mediated  or  computer-based  attacks.635 In  this  regard,  the  ability to take down any enemy without getting involved in a fight was one of the key components at the  heart  of  the  debate  from  the  outset.636 In  addition,  network-based  attacks  are  generally  cheaper  than  traditional military operations637 and can be carried out even by small states.
However, the classification of  an attack as an act of war requires that certain criteria be fulfilled.
In 2007, Estonia experienced heated debate over the removal of a Second World War memorial, including  street  riots  in  the  capital.639 Apart  from  traditional  forms  of  protest,  Estonia  at  that  time  discovered  several waves of computer-related attacks against government and private business websites and online  services640,  including  defacement  of  websites641,  attacks  against  domain  name  servers  and  distributed  denial of service attacks (DDoS), where botnets were used.642 With regard to the latter, experts explained  afterwards that successful attacks against the official website of governmental organizations in Estonia643  could only take place due to inadequate protection measures.644 The impact of the attacks as well as their  origin  were  subsequently  the  subject  of  controversial  discussion.
Despite being computer- related  attacks  against  government  and  private  business  websites  and  online  services650,  including  defacement  of  websites651 and  distributed  denial  of  service  attacks  (DDoS)652,  such  attacks  cannot  be  characterized as cyberwarfare as they neither constituted an act of force nor took place during a conflict  between two sovereign states.
In the context of a traditional armed conflict653 between the Russian Federation and  Georgia,  several  computer-related  attacks  targeting  Georgian  government  websites  and  businesses654  (including the defacement of websites and distributed denial of service attacks) were discovered.655 Just  as  in  the  Estonian  incident,  the  origin  of  the  attack  against  Georgia  was  much  debated  afterwards.
Propaganda is spread through the Internet and attacks  against computer systems of military alliances are a rather common concept.
Already during the war in  Yugoslavia,  attacks  against  NATO  computer  systems  originating  from  Serbia  were  discovered.658 In  response, NATO Member States were reported to have been involved in similar attacks against computer  systems in Serbia.659 Further computer-related propaganda and other forms of psychological operations  (PSYOPS) designed to undermine the other side’s resolve were intensively utilized.660    38   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Importance of differentiation   Potentially war-related acts show many similarities to other forms of abuse of ICT, such as cybercrime and  terrorist use of the Internet.
As a consequence, the terms “cybercrime”, “terrorist use of the Internet”  and “cyberwarfare” are frequently used interchangeably.
While  cybercrime  is  in  general  addressed  by  acts  criminalizing  such  conduct,  the  rules  and  procedures  related  to  warfare  are  largely  regulated  by  international law, and particularly the Charter of the United Nations.
Cyberlaundering   2.9.3  The  Internet  is  transforming  money-laundering.
For  larger  amounts,  traditional  money-laundering  techniques still offer a number of advantages, but the Internet offers several advantages.
The Internet  has  helped  overcome  the  dependence  on  physical  monetary  transactions.
Wire  transfers  replaced  the  transport of hard cash as the original first step in suppressing physical dependence on money, but stricter  regulations  to  detect  suspicious  wire  transfers  have  forced  offenders  to  develop  new  techniques.
With regard to the placement of large amounts of cash, the use of the Internet might perhaps not offer  that many tangible advantages.662 However, the Internet is especially useful for offenders in the layering  (or  masking)  phase.
In  this  context,  the  investigation  of  money-laundering  is  especially  difficult  when  money-launderers use online casinos for layering.663   The regulation of money transfers is currently limited and the Internet offers offenders the possibility of  cheap and tax-free money transfers across borders.
The use of virtual currencies  One  of  the  key  drivers  in  the  development  of  virtual  currencies  were  micro-payments  (e.g.
With  the  growing  demand  for  micro-payments,  virtual  currencies,  including  “virtual  gold  currencies”,  were  developed.
Account-holders  may  also  use  inaccurate  information  during  registration to mask their identity.665   In  addition  to  simple  virtual  currencies  there  are  also  currencies  that  combine  the  virtual  aspect  with  anonymity.
One  example  is  Bitcoin,  a  virtual  currency  using  peer-to-peer  technology.666 Although  it  is  a  decentralized systems that does not require central intermediaries to ensure the validity of transactions  authorities successful attacks in 2011 underline the vulnerability/risks related to such decentralized virtual  currencies.
Furthermore,  the  Internet  transfers  often  involve  the  cross-border  participation  of  providers  in  various  countries.
Phishing   2.9.4  Offenders have developed techniques to obtain personal information from users, ranging from spyware673  to  “phishing”  attacks.
Offenders  design  websites  resembling  the  legitimate  websites  (“spoofing  sites”)  requiring  victims  to  perform  normal  log  in  procedures,  enabling  offenders  to  obtain  personal  information  (e.g.
In  order  to  direct  users  to  spoofing  sites,  offenders  send  out  e-mails  resembling  e-mails  from  the  legitimate company,677 often resulting in trademark violations.678 The false e-mails ask recipients to log in  for  updates  or  security  checks,  sometimes  with  threats  (e.g.
Offenders  have  developed  advanced techniques to prevent users from realizing that they are not on the genuine website.679   As soon as personal information is disclosed, offenders log in to victims’ accounts and commit offences  such  as  the  transfer  of  money,  application  for  passports  or  new  accounts,  etc.
The  rising  number  of  successful attacks proves phishing’s potential.680 More than 55 000 unique phishing sites were reported to  APWG681 in April 2007.682 Phishing techniques are not limited to accessing passwords for online banking  only.
Offenders may also seek access codes to computers, auction platforms and social security numbers,  which are particularly important in the United States and can give rise to “identity theft” offences.683            82   Other terminology used includes information technology crime and high-tech crime.

It aims at filling gaps in  criminal law related to traditional forgery, which requires visual readability of statements, or declarations embodied in  a document and which does not apply to electronically stored data.
Computer- related forgery involves unauthorised creating or altering stored data so that they acquire a different evidentiary value  in the course of legal transactions, which relies on the authenticity of information contained in the data, is subject to a  deception.”   190  From a legal perspective, there is no real need to differentiate between “computer hackers” and “computer crackers”  as – in the context of illegal access – both terms are used to describe persons who enter a computer system without  right.
191  In the early years of IT development, the term “hacking” was used to describe the attempt to get more out of a system  (software or hardware) than it was designed for.

675  The term “phishing” originally described the use of e-mails to “phish” for passwords and financial data from a sea of  Internet users.
It is thus likely that organized crime groups that are involved  in spam are also involved in phishing scams, as they make use of the same spam databases.
680  In some phishing attacks, as many as 5 per cent of victims provided sensitive information on fake websites.

Recent developments in ICTs have not only resulted in new cybercrimes and new criminal methods, but  also  new  methods  of  investigating  cybercrime.
Hash-value  based approaches are only successful if pictures have been rated previously, the hash value is stored in a  database and the picture that was analysed has not been modified.685  Forensic software is able to search automatically for child-pornography images by comparing the files on  the hard disk of suspects with information about known images.
In order to prevent identification the offender  had digitally modified the part of the pictures showing his face before publishing the pictures over the  Internet.
3.2  General challenges   Reliance on ICTs   3.2.1  Many  everyday  communications  depend  on  ICTs  and  Internet-based  services,  including  VoIP  calls  or  e- mail  communications.
687 ICTs  are  now  responsible  for  the  control  and  management  functions  in  buildings,688 cars  and  aviation  services.689 The  supply  of  energy,  water  and  communication  services  depend on ICTs.
Developing countries also  face  challenges  in  preventing  attacks  against  their  infrastructure  and  users.697 The  development  of  cheaper infrastructure technologies such as WiMAX698 has enabled developing countries to offer Internet  services to more people.
Developing countries can avoid the mistakes of some western countries, which  have  concentrated  mainly  on  maximizing  accessibility,  without  investing  significantly  in  protection.
US  experts have explained that successful attacks against the official website of governmental organizations  in Estonia699 could only take place due to inadequate protection measures.700 Developing countries have a  unique  opportunity  to  integrate  security  measures  early  on.
This  may  require  greater  upfront  investments, but the integration of security measures at a later point may prove more expensive in the  long run.701  Strategies  must  be  formulated  to  prevent  such  attacks  and  develop  countermeasures,  including  the  development  and  promotion  of  technical  means  of  protection,  as  well  as  adequate  and  sufficient  laws  enabling law-enforcement agencies to fight cybercrime effectively.702   3.2.2  Number of users  The popularity of the Internet and its services is growing fast, with over 2 billion Internet users worldwide  by 2010.703 Computer companies and ISPs are focusing on developing countries with the greatest potential  for  further  growth.704 In  2005,  the  number  of  Internet  users  in  developing  countries  surpassed  the  number in industrial nations,705 while the development of cheap hardware and wireless access will enable  even more people to access the Internet.706   With  the  growing  number  of  people  connected  to  the  Internet,  the  number  of  targets  and  offenders  increases.707 It is difficult to estimate how many people use the Internet for illegal activities.
Although Internet usage rates are lower in developing countries, promoting cybersecurity is not easier, as  offenders can commit offences from around the world.708   The increasing number of Internet users causes difficulties for the law-enforcement agencies because it is  relatively difficult to automate investigation processes.
Hash-value  based approaches are for example only successful if the pictures were rated previously, the hash value  was stored in a data base, and the picture that was analysed has not been modified.709    Availability of devices and access   3.2.3  Only basic equipment is needed to commit computer crimes.
Committing an offence requires hardware,  software and Internet access.
With  regard  to  hardware,  the  power  of  computers  is  growing  continuously.710 There  are  a  number  of  initiatives  to  enable  people  in  developing  countries  to  use  ICTs  more  widely.711 Criminals  can  commit  serious computer crimes with only cheap or second-hand computer technology – knowledge counts for  far more than equipment.
The date of the computer technology available has little influence on the use of  that equipment to commit cybercrimes.
Offenders  can  download  software  tools712 designed  to  locate  open  ports  or  break  password  protection.713 Due  to  mirroring  techniques and peer-to-peer exchange, it is difficult to limit the widespread availability of such devices.714   The  last  vital  element  is  Internet  access.
Although  the  cost  of  Internet  access715 is  higher  in  most  developing  countries  than  in  industrialized  countries,  the  number  of  Internet  users  in  developing  countries is growing rapidly.716 Offenders will generally not subscribe to an Internet service to limit their  chances of being identified, but prefer services they can use without (verified) registration.
A typical way  of getting access to networks is the so-called “wardriving”.
The term describes the act of driving around  searching for accessible wireless networks.717 The most common methods criminals can use to access the  network fairly anonymously are public Internet terminals, open (wireless) networks718, hacked networks  and prepaid services without registration requirements.
Law-enforcement agencies are taking action to restrict uncontrolled access to Internet services to avoid  criminal  abuse  of  these  services.
In  Italy  and  China,  for  example,  the  use  of  public  Internet  terminals  requires  the  identification  of  users.
719 However,  there  are  arguments  against  such  identification  requirements.720 Although the restriction of access could prevent crimes and facilitate the investigations  of law-enforcement agencies, such legislation could hinder the growth of the information society and the  development of e-commerce.721   It  has  been  suggested  that  this  limitation  on  access  to  the  Internet  could  violate  human  rights.722 For  example, the European Court has ruled in a number of cases on broadcasting that the right to freedom of  expression  applies  not  only  to  the  content  of  information,  but  also  to  the  means  of  transmission  or  reception.
In the case Autronic v. Switzerland,723 the court held that extensive interpretation is necessary  since  any  restriction  imposed  on  the  means  necessarily  interferes  with  the  right  to  receive  and  impart  information.
If these principles are applied to potential limitations on Internet access, it is possible that  such legislative approaches could entail violation of human rights.
Availability of information   3.2.4  The Internet has millions of webpages724 of up-to-date information.
One  example  of  the  success  of  user-generated  platforms  is  Wikipedia,725 an  online encyclopaedia where anybody can publish.726   The success of the Internet also depends on powerful search engines that enable users to search millions  of  webpages  in  seconds.
This  technology  can  be  used  for  both  legitimate  and  criminal  purposes.
“Googlehacking”  or  “Googledorks”  describes  the  use  of  complex  search-engine  queries  to  filter  many  search results for information on computer security issues.
For example, offenders might aim to search  for  insecure  password  protection  systems.727 Reports  have  highlighted  the  risk  of  the  use  of  search  engines  for  illegal  purposes.728 An  offender  who  plans  an  attack  can  find  detailed  information  on  the  Internet  that  explains  how  to  build  a  bomb  using  only  chemicals  available  in  regular  supermarkets.729  Although  information  like  this  was  available  even  before  the  Internet  was  developed,  it  was  however,   76   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     much more difficult to get access to that information.
Today, any Internet user can get access to those  instructions.
Criminals  can  also  use  search  engines  to  analyse  targets.730 A  training  manual  was  found  during  investigations against members of a terrorist group highlighting how useful the Internet is for gathering  information  on  possible  targets.
731 Using  search  engines,  offenders  can  collect  publicly  available  information  (e.g.
It  has  been  reported  that  insurgents  attacking  British  troops  in  Afghanistan  used  satellite  images  from  Google  Earth.732    3.2.5  Missing mechanisms of control  All mass communication networks – from phone networks used for voice phone calls to the Internet –  need central administration and technical standards to ensure operability.
The ongoing discussions about  Internet  governance  suggest  that  the  Internet  is  no  different  compared  with  national  and  even  transnational communication infrastructure.733 The Internet also needs to be governed by laws, and law- makers  and  law-enforcement  agencies  have  started  to  develop  legal  standards  necessitating  a  certain  degree of central control.
The  Internet  was  originally  designed  as  a  military  network 734 based  on  a  decentralized  network  architecture that sought to preserve the main functionality intact and in power, even when components  of the network were attacked.
As a result, the Internet’s network infrastructure is resistant to external  attempts at control.
It was not originally designed to facilitate criminal investigations or to prevent attacks  from inside the network.
Today, the Internet is increasingly used for civil services.
With the shift from military to civil services, the  nature of demand for control instruments has changed.
Since the network is based on protocols designed  for military purposes, these central control instruments do not exist and it is difficult to implement them  retrospectively, without significant redesign of the network.
The absence of control instruments makes  cybercrime investigations very difficult.735   One  example  of  the  problems  posed  by  the  absence  of  control  instruments  is  the  ability  of  users  to  circumvent filter technology736 using encrypted anonymous communication services.737 If access providers  block certain websites with illegal content (such as child pornography), customers are generally unable to  access those websites.
In  this  case,  providers  may  be  unable  to  block  requests  because  requests  sent  as  encrypted  messages  cannot  be  opened by access providers.
International dimensions    3.2.6  Many  data  transfer  processes  affect  more  than  one  country.738 The  protocols  used  for  Internet  data  transfers  are  based  on  optimal  routing  if  direct  links  are  temporarily  blocked.739 Even  where  domestic  transfer processes within the source country are limited, data can leave the country, be transmitted over  routers outside the territory and be redirected back into the country to the final destination.740 Further,  many Internet services are based on services from abroad741, e.g.
The  formal requirements and time needed to collaborate with foreign law-enforcement agencies often hinder  investigations.745 Investigations  often  occur  in  very  short  time-frames.746 Data  vital  for  tracing  offences  are  often  deleted  after  only  a  short  time.
This  short  investigation  period  is  problematic,  because   law-enforcement  agencies      77   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     traditional  mutual  legal  assistance  regime  often  takes  time  to  organize.
747 The  principle  of  dual  criminality748 also poses difficulties, if the offence is not criminalized in one of the countries involved in  the  investigation.749 Offenders  may be  deliberately  including  third  countries  in  their  attacks  in  order  to  make investigation more difficult.750  Criminals  may  deliberately  choose  targets  outside  their  own  country  and  act  from  countries  with  inadequate  cybercrime  legislation.751 The  harmonization  of  cybercrime-related  laws  and  international  cooperation  would  help.
Two  approaches  to  improve  the  speed  of  international  cooperation  in  cybercrime  investigations  are  the  G8  24/7  Network752 and  the  provisions  related  to  international  cooperation in the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.753    Independence of location and presence at the crime site   3.2.7  Criminals need not be present at the same location as the target.
International cybercrime  offences take considerable effort and time.
Developing countries that have not yet  implemented cybercrime legislation may become vulnerable, as criminals may choose to base themselves  in  these  countries  to  avoid  prosecution.
One  example  of  this  is  the  “Love  Bug”  computer  worm  developed  by  a  suspect  in  the  Philippines  in  2000,756 which  infected  millions  of  computers  worldwide.757 Local  investigations  were  hindered  by  the  fact  that  the  development  and  spreading  of  malicious software was not at that time adequately criminalized in the Philippines.758 Another example is  Nigeria, which has come under pressure to take action over financial scams distributed by e-mail.
Automation of attacks affects developing countries in particular.
Due to their limited resources, spam may  pose  a  more  serious  issue  for  developing  countries  than  for  industrialized  countries.767 The  greater  numbers  of  crimes  that  can  be  committed  through  automation  pose  challenges  for  law-enforcement  agencies worldwide, as they will have to be prepared for many more victims within their jurisdictions.
Increasing network capacities is also a major issue.
One  example  is  the  recent  attacks  against  government  websites  in  Estonia.769 Analysis  of  the  attacks  suggests  that  they  were  committed  by  thousands  of  computers  within  a  “botnet”770 or  group  of  compromised  computers  running  programs  under  external  control.771 In  most  cases,  computers  are   78   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     infected with malicious software that installs tools allowing perpetrators to take control.
Botnets are used  to gather information about targets or for high-level attacks.772   Over recent years, botnets have become a serious risk for cybersecurity.773 The size of a botnet can vary,  from a few computers to more than a million computers.774 Current analysis suggests that up to a quarter  of  all  computers  connected  to  the  Internet  could  be  infected  with  software  making  them  part  of  a  botnet.775 Botnets can be used for various criminal activities, including denial of service attacks,776 sending  out spam,777 hacking attacks and the exchange of copyright-protected files.
They  increase  both  the  computer  and  network  capacity of criminals.
As criminals  control more powerful computer systems and networks, the gap between the capacities of investigating  authorities and those under control of criminals is getting wider.
This short period of time is one  reason for the success of the Internet, as e-mails have eliminated the time for the physical transport of a  message.
The main difference between the exchange of child pornography on and off the Internet is  transportation.
When offenders use the Internet, movies can be exchanged in seconds.
For  tracing and identifying suspects, investigators often need access to data that may be deleted shortly after  transfer.780 A  very  short  response  time  by  the  investigative  authorities  is  often  vital  for  a  successful  investigation.
Without adequate legislation and instruments allowing investigators to act immediately and  prevent data from being deleted, an effective fight against cybercrime may not be possible.781   “Quick  freeze  procedures”782 and  24/7  network  points783 are  examples  of  tools  that  can  speed  up  investigations.
3.2.11  Speed of development   The Internet is constantly undergoing development.
Further developments continue, notably with online games and voice  over IP (VoIP) communication.
Online games are ever more popular, but it is unclear whether law-enforcement agencies can successfully  investigate and prosecute offences committed in this virtual world.786   The  switch  from  traditional  voice  calls  to  Internet  telephony  also  presents  new  challenges  for  law- enforcement agencies.
The techniques and routines developed by law-enforcement agencies to intercept  classic phone calls do not generally apply to VoIP communications.
However, if the service is based on peer-to-peer technology, service providers may generally be unable to  intercept  communications,  as  the  relevant  data  are  transferred  directly  between  the  communicating  partners.787 Therefore, new techniques are needed.788       79   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     New  hardware  devices  with  network  technology  are  also  developing  rapidly.
The  latest  home  entertainment  systems  turn  TVs  into  Internet  access  points,  while  more  recent  mobile  handsets  store  data and connect to the Internet via wireless networks.789 USB (universal serial bus) memory devices with  more than 1 GB capacity have been integrated into watches, pens and pocket knives.
Law-enforcement  agencies need to take these developments into account in their work – it is essential to educate officers  involved in cybercrime investigations continuously, so they are up to date with the latest technology and  able to identify relevant hardware and any specific devices that need to be seized.
Another  challenge  is  the  use  of  wireless  access  points.
The  expansion  of  wireless  Internet  access  in  developing  countries  is  an  opportunity,  as  well  as  a  challenge  for  law-enforcement  agencies.790 If  offenders  use  wireless  access  points  that  do  not  require  registration,  it  is  more  challenging  for  law- enforcement agencies to trace offenders, as investigations lead only to access points.
However,  the  distributed  nature  of  the  network791,  as  well  the  availability  of  certain  Internet  services,  which create uncertainty of origin, make it difficult to identify offenders.792 The possibility of anonymous  communication  can  be  either  just  a  by-product  of  a  service  or  offered  with  the  intention  of  avoiding  disadvantages  for  the  user.
Being  mindful  of  uncertainty  of  origin  is  crucial  to  prevent  incorrect  conclusions.793 Examples of such services – which can even be combined – are:   •  public Internet terminals (e.g.
at airport terminals or Internet cafés);794   •  network address translation (NAT) devices and virtual private networks (VPN);795  •  wireless networks;796  •  prepaid mobile services that do not need registration;  •  •  anonymous communication servers;797  •  anonymous remailers.798   storage capacities for homepages offered without registration;   Offenders  can  hide  their  identities  through,  for  example,  the  use  of  fake  e-mail  addresses.799 Many  providers  offer  free  e-mail  addresses.
Where  personal  information  has  to  be  entered,  it  may  not  be  verified,  so  users  can  register  e-mail  addresses  without  revealing  their  identity.
if  users  wish  to  join  political  discussion  groups  without  identification.
Anonymous communications may give rise to anti-social behaviour, but they can also allow users to act  more freely.800   Given  that  users  leave  various  traces,  there  is  a  need  for  instruments  to  protect  them  from  profiling  activities.801 Therefore,  various  states  and  organizations  support  the  principle  of  anonymous  use  of  Internet  e-mail  services.
This  principle  is  expressed,  for  instance,  in  the  European  Union  Directive  on  Privacy and Electronic Communications.802 One example of a legal approach to protect user privacy can be  found in Article 37 of the European Union Regulation on Data Protection.803 However, some countries are  addressing the challenges of anonymous communications by implementing legal restrictions.804 Italy, for  instance, requires public Internet access providers to identify users before they start using the service.805   These measures aim to help law-enforcement agencies identify suspects, but they can be easily avoided.
Criminals  may  use  unprotected  private  wireless  networks  or  SIM-cards  from  countries  not  requiring  registration.
It is unclear whether the restriction of anonymous communications and anonymous access  to the Internet should play a more important role in cybersecurity strategies.806    3.2.13  Failure of traditional investigation instruments  Investigating  and  prosecuting  cybercrime  requires  Internet-specific  tools  and  instruments  that  enable  competent authorities to carry out investigations.807 In this context, instruments to identify the offender   80   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     and collect the evidence required for the criminal proceedings are essential.808 These instruments may be  the same as those used in traditional terrorist investigations unrelated to computer technology.
One example is the interception of voice-over-IP (VoIP) communication.809 In recent  decades,  states  have  developed  investigation  instruments,  such  as  wiretapping,  that  enable  them  to  intercept landline as well as mobile-phone communications.810 The interception of traditional voice calls is  usually carried out through telecom providers.811 Applying the same principle to VoIP, law-enforcement  agencies  would  operate  through  Internet  service  providers  (ISPs)  and  service  providers  supplying  VoIP  services.
However, if the service is based on peer-to-peer technology, service providers may generally be  unable  to  is  transferred  directly  between  the  communicating  partners.812 Therefore,  new  technical  solutions  together  with  related  legal  instruments  are necessary.
intercept  communications,  as  the  relevant  data   3.2.14  Encryption technology  Another  factor  that  can  complicate  the  investigation  of  cybercrime  is  encryption  technology,813 which  protects  information  from  access  by  unauthorized  people  and  is  a  key  technical  solution  in  the  fight  against cybercrime.814 Encryption is a technique of turning a plain text into an obscured format by using  an algorithm.815 Like anonymity, encryption is not new,816 but computer technology has transformed the  field.
In an interconnected environment, such secrecy is difficult  to maintain.817   The widespread availability of easy-to-use software tools and the integration of encryption technology in  the operating systems818 now makes it possible to encrypt computer data with the click of a mouse and  thereby increases the chance of law-enforcement agencies being confronted with encrypted material.819  Various software products are available that enable users to protect files against unauthorized access.820  But it is uncertain to what extent offenders already use encryption technology to mask their activities.821  One survey on child pornography suggested that only 6 per cent of arrested child-pornography possessors  used  encryption  technology822,  but  experts  highlight  the  threat  of  an  increasing  use  of  encryption  technology in cybercrime cases.823  There are different technical strategies to cover encrypted data and several software tools are available to  automate these processes.824 Strategies range from analysing825 weakness in the software tools used to  encrypt  files,826 searching  for  encryption  passphrases827 and  trying  typical  passwords,  to  complex  and  lengthy brute-force attacks.
Although  some  computer  forensic  experts  believe  that  this  function  does  not  threaten  them,834 the  widespread  availability  of  this  technology  for  any  user  could  result  in  greater use of encryption.
Tools are also available to encrypt communications – for example, e-mails and  phone calls835 – that can be sent using VoIP.836 Using encrypted VoIP technology, offenders can protect  voice conversations from interception.837   Techniques can also be combined.
Using software tools, offenders can encrypt messages and exchange  them in pictures or images – this technology is called steganography.838 For investigative authorities, it is      81   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     difficult  to  distinguish  the  harmless  exchange  of  holiday  pictures  and  the  exchange  of  pictures  with  encrypted hidden messages.839   The  availability  and  use  of  encryption  technologies  by  criminals  is  a  challenge  for  law-enforcement  agencies.
Various  legal  approaches  to  address  the  problem  are  currently  under  discussion,840 including:  potential  obligations  for  software  developers  to  install  a  back-door  for  law-enforcement  agencies;  limitations on key strength; and obligations to disclose keys, in the case of criminal investigations.841 But  encryption technology is not only used by offenders – there are various ways such technology is used for  legal purposes.
Without adequate access to encryption technology, it may be difficult to protect sensitive  information.
Given  the  growing  number  of  attacks,842 self-protection  is  an  important  element  of  cybersecurity.
This  section  has  reviewed  key  challenges  to  promoting  cybersecurity  and  areas  where  existing  instruments  may  prove  insufficient  and  the  implementation  of  special instruments may be necessary.
However, law- makers must continuously  respond to Internet developments and monitor the effectiveness of existing  provisions, especially given the speed of developments in network technology.
Historically, the introduction of computer-related services or Internet-related technologies has given rise  to new forms of crime, soon after the technology was introduced.
One example is the development of  computer networks in the 1970s – the first unauthorized access to computer networks occurred shortly  afterwards.843 Similarly,  the  first  software  offences  appeared  soon  after  the  introduction  of  personal  computers in the 1980s, when these systems were used to copy software products.
For  example,  digital  information  must  have  equivalent status as traditional signatures and printouts.844 Without the integration of cybercrime-related  offences, violations cannot be prosecuted.
The main challenge for national criminal legal systems is the delay between the recognition of potential  abuses  of  new  technologies  and  necessary  amendments  to  the  national  criminal  law.
This  challenge  remains as relevant and topical as ever as the speed of network innovation accelerates.
Many countries  are working hard to catch up with legislative adjustments.845 In general, the adjustment process has three  steps: adjustment to national law, identification of gaps in the penal code, and drafting of new legislation.
Adjustments to national law must start with the recognition of an abuse of new technology  Specific  departments  are  needed  within  national  law-enforcement  agencies,  which  are  qualified  to  investigate potential cybercrimes.
The development of computer emergency response teams (CERTs),846  computer incident response teams (CIRTs), computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) and other  research facilities have improved the situation.
Identification of gaps in the penal code  To  ensure  effective  legislative  foundations,  it  is  necessary  to  compare  the  status  of  criminal  legal  provisions in the national law with requirements arising from the new kinds of criminal offences.
Drafting of new legislation  Based  on  experience,  it  may  be  difficult  for  national  authorities  to  execute  the  drafting  process  for  cybercrime without international cooperation, due to the rapid development of network technologies and  their complex structures.847 Drafting cybercrime legislation separately may result in significant duplication  and waste of resources, and it is also necessary to monitor the development of international standards  and  strategies.
Without  the  international  harmonization  of  national  criminal  legal  provisions,  the  fight  against  transnational  cybercrime  will  run  into  serious  difficulties,  due  to  inconsistent  or  incompatible  national legislations.
Consequently, international attempts to harmonize different national penal laws are  increasingly  important.848 National  law  can  greatly  benefit  from  the  experience  of  other  countries  and  international expert legal advice.
Apart from adjustment for well-known scams, law-makers must continuously analyse new and developing  types of cybercrime to ensure their effective criminalization.
the requirement for verification  of  age)  and  illegal  content  (e.g.
access  to  child  pornography  in  the  online  game  “Second  Life”).851 New  criminal activities are constantly being discovered.
In order to prevent safe havens for offenders, it is vital to monitor developments worldwide.
Some  instruments (such as data retention855) could interfere with the rights of innocent Internet users.856 If the  severity  of  the  criminal  offence  is  out  of  proportion  with  the  intensity  of  interference,  the  use  of  investigative  instruments  could  be  unjustified  or  unlawful.
The introduction of investigative instruments is always the result of a trade-off between the advantages  for law-enforcement agencies and interference with the rights of innocent Internet users.
83   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response   Developing procedures for digital evidence     3.3.4  Especially  due  the  low  costs857 compared  to  the  storage  of  physical  documents,  the  number  of  digital  documents is increasing.858 Digitization and the emerging use of ICTs  has a great impact on procedures  related to the collection of evidence and its use in court.859 As a consequence of this development, digital  evidence  has  been  introduced  as  a  new  source  of  evidence.860 It  is  defined  as  any  data  stored  or  transmitted using computer technology that supports the theory of how an offence occurred.861 Handling  digital  evidence  is  accompanied  with  unique  challenges  and  requires  specific  procedures.862 One  of  the  most difficult aspects is to maintain the integrity of the digital evidence.863 Digital data are highly fragile  and can easily be deleted864 or modified.
This is especially relevant for information stored in the system  memory  RAM  that  is  automatically  deleted  when  the  system  is  shut  down865 and  therefore  requires  special preservation techniques.866 In addition, new developments can have great impact on dealing with  digital  evidence.
Today, they need to take into consideration that  digital information might be stored abroad and can only be accessed remotely, if necessary.867  Digital  evidence  plays  an  important  role  in  various  phases  of  cybercrime  investigations.
It  is  in  general  possible  to  separate  four  phases.868 The  first  phase  is  identification  of  the  relevant  evidence.869 It  is  followed  by  collection  and  preservation  of  the  evidence.870 The  third  phase  includes  the  analysis  of  computer technology and digital evidence.
In  addition  to  the  procedures  that  relate  to  the  presentation  of  digital  evidence  in  court,  the  ways  in  which digital evidence is collected requires special attention.
The term ‘computer forensics’ describes the systematic analysis of IT equipment for  the purpose of searching for digital evidence.871 The fact that the amount of data stored in digital format is  constantly increasing, highlights the logistic challenges of such investigations.872 Approaches to automated  forensic procedures using, for example, hash-value based searches for known child-pornography images873  or a keyword search874 therefore play an important role in addition to manual investigations.875   Depending on the requirement of the specific investigation, computer forensics could for example include  analysing the hardware and software used by a suspect876, supporting investigators in identifying relevant  evidence,877 recovering deleted files,878 decrypting files879 and identifying Internet users by analysing traffic  data.880            684  See: Giordano/Maciag, Cyber Forensics: A Military Operations Perspective, International Journal of Digital Evidence,   Vol.

Examples include Art.
749  Regarding the dual criminality principle in international investigations, see: United Nations Manual on the Prevention   and Control of Computer-Related Crime, page 269, available at www.uncjin.org/Documents/EighthCongress.html;  Schjolberg/Hubbard, Harmonizing National Legal Approaches on Cybercrime, 2005, page 5, available at:  http://.itu.int/osg/spu/cybersecurity/presentations/session12_schjolberg.pdf.
751  Regarding the extend of cross-border cases related to computer fraud, see: Beales, Efforts to Fight Fraud on the   Internet, Statement before the Senate Special Committee on aging, 2004, page 9, available at:  www.ftc.gov/os/2004/03/bealsfraudtest.pdf.
Although most sites are still stored in the United States (32%), which has strong legislation in   place, countries such as China (13%), Russia (7%) and the Republic of Korea (6%), which may have less effective  instruments in the field of international cooperation in place, are playing a more important role.
Apart from the United  States, none of them has yet signed and ratified cybercrime specific international agreements that would enable and  oblige them to effectively participate in international investigations.
755  This issue was addressed by a number of international organizations.
UN General Assembly Resolution 55/63 points   out: “States should ensure that their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse  information technologies”.
The G8 10 Point Action plan highlights: “There must be no safe  havens for those who abuse information technologies”.

The  growing  number  of  recognized  cybercrimes  and  technical  tools  to  automate  cybercrime  offences  (including  anonymous  file-sharing  systems881 and  software  products  designed  to  develop  computer  viruses882) mean that the fight against cybercrime has become an essential element of law-enforcement  activities  worldwide.
Cybercrime  is  a  challenge  to  law-enforcement  agencies  in  both  developed  and  developing  countries.
Since  ICTs  evolve  so  rapidly,  especially  in  developing  countries,  the  creation  and  implementation  of  an  effective  anti-cybercrime  strategy  as  part  of  a  national  cybersecurity  strategy  is  essential.
Cybercrime legislation as an integral part of a cybersecurity strategy   4.1  As  pointed  out  previously,  cybersecurity883 plays  an  important  role  in  the  ongoing  development  of  information technology, as well as Internet services.884 Making the Internet safer (and protecting Internet  users)  has  become  integral  to  the  development  of  new  services  as  well  as  governmental  policy.885  Cybersecurity strategies – for example, the development of technical protection systems or the education  of  users  to  prevent  them  from  becoming  victims  of  cybercrime  –  can  help  to  reduce  the  risk  of  cybercrime.886   An  anti-cybercrime  strategy  should  be  an  integral  element  of  a  cybersecurity  strategy.
The  ITU  Global  Cybersecurity Agenda,887 as a global framework for dialogue and international cooperation to coordinate  the  international  response  to  the  growing  challenges  to  cybersecurity  and  to  enhance  confidence  and  security in the information society, builds on existing work, initiatives and partnerships with the objective  of proposing global strategies to address these related challenges.
All the required measures highlighted  in the five pillars of Global Cybersecurity Agenda are relevant to any cybersecurity strategy.
Furthermore,  the ability to effectively fight against cybercrime requires measures to be undertaken within all of the five  pillars.888       97   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response   Implementation of existing strategies     4.1.1  One possibility is that anti-cybercrime strategies developed in industrialized countries could be introduced  in  developing  countries,  offering  advantages  of  reduced  cost  and  time  for  development.
The  implementation of existing strategies could enable developing countries to benefit from existing insights  and experience.
Nevertheless, the implementation of an existing anti-cybercrime strategy poses a number of difficulties.
Although similar challenges confront both developing and developed countries, the optimal solutions that  might be adopted depend on the resources and capabilities of each country.
Industrialized countries may  be  able  to  promote  cybersecurity  in  different  and  more  flexible  ways,  e.g.
There  are  several  other  issues  that  need  to  be  taken  into  account  by  developing  countries  adopting  existing anti-cybercrime strategies.
They include compatibility of respective legal systems, the status of  supporting  initiatives  (e.g.
education  of  the  society),  the  extent  of  self-protection  measures  in  place  as  well as the extent of private sector support (e.g.
Regional differences   4.1.2  Given the international nature of cybercrime, the harmonization of national laws and techniques is vital in  the  fight  against  cybercrime.
The  importance  of  regional  aspects  in  the  implementation  of  anti-cybercrime  strategies  is  underlined  by  the  fact  that  many  legal  and  technical  standards  were  agreed  among  industrialized  countries and do not include various aspects important for developing countries.889 Therefore, regional  factors and differences need to be included within their implementation elsewhere.
Relevance of cybercrime issues within the pillars of cybersecurity   4.1.3  The  Global  Cybersecurity  Agenda  has  seven  main  strategic  goals,  built  on  five  work  areas:  1) Legal  measures;  2) Technical  and  procedural  measures;  3) Organizational  structures;  4) Capacity  building;  and 5) International cooperation.
As pointed out above, issues related to cybercrime play an important  role in all five pillars of the Global Cybersecurity Agenda.
Among these work areas, the “Legal measures”  work areas focuses on how to address the legislative challenges posed by criminal activities committed  over ICT networks in an internationally compatible manner.
A cybercrime policy as starting point   4.2  Developing  legislation  to  criminalize  certain  conduct  or  introduce  investigation  instruments  is  a  rather  unusual process for most countries.
And even if the decision  is made that there is a need to implement legislation, it does not necessarily need to focus on criminal law  but could also include legislation more focussed on crime prevention.
In this regard, developing a policy  enables  a  government  to  comprehensively  define  the  government  response  to  a  problem.
As  the  fight  against cybercrime can never solely be limited to introducing legislation, but contains various strategies  with different measures, the policy can ensure that those different measures don’t cause conflicts.
Within different approaches to harmonize cybercrime legislation too little priority has been given to not  only integrating the legislation in the national legal framework but also including it into an existing policy,  or  developing  such  policy  for  the  first  time.
As  a  consequence  some  countries  that  merely  introduced  cybercrime  legislation  without  having  developed  an  anti-cybercrime  strategy  as  well  as  policies  on  the  government  level  faced  severe  difficulties.
They  were  mainly  a  result  of  a  lack  of  crime  prevention  measures as well as an overlapping between different measures.
Overlapping  between different ministries is nothing unusual – with regard to cybercrime it is happening frequently as  it is an interdisciplinary subject.892 Aspects related to the fight against cybercrime may be related to the  mandate of the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Communication or Ministry of National Security to name  only three.
Within the process of developing a policy, the role of the different government institutions  involved can be defined.
This is another issue expressed in the ICB4PAC894 Draft Model Policy for Cybercrime:   Addressing the multi-dimensional challenges of fighting Cybercrime requires a comprehensive approach  that  should  include  overall  policies,  legislation,  education  and  awareness  raising,  capacity  building,  research as well as technical approaches.
Ideally the policy should be used to coordinate the various activities – even if they are implemented by  different ministries and government bodies.
The fact that policies in general require approval by cabinet  therefore not only enables the identification of different government bodies and ministries involved with  regard to the topic, but also enables the harmonization of their activities.895    Determination of stakeholders   4.2.3  The  policy  can  not  only  identify  the  government  institutions  involved  but  also  the  stakeholders  that  should  be  addressed.
It  may,  for  example,  be  necessary  to  develop  guidelines  with  regard  to  the  involvement of the private sector.
The  issue  of  stakeholders  that  should  be  involved  and  addressed  is,  for  example,  expressed  in  the  ICB4PAC896 Draft Model Policy for Cybercrime:  Further  more  such  approach  needs  to  involve  various  stakeholders  such  as  government,  ministries  and  government  agencies,  private  sector,  schools  and  universities,  customary  leaders,  community,  international  and  regional  bodies,  law  enforcement,  judges,  customs,  prosecutors,  lawyers,  civil  society  and NGOs.
Identification of benchmarks   4.2.4  As underlined further below the importance of harmonization of legislation is identified as a key priority  by  different  regional  organizations.897 But  the  need  for  harmonization  is  not  limited  to  legislation  –  it  includes issues like strategy and training of experts.898 The policy can be used to identify the areas where  harmonization  should  take  place  as  well  as  to  define  the  regional  and/or  international  standards  that  should be implemented.
99   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     With regard to the global dimension of Cybercrime as well as the need to protect the Internet users in the  region  from  becoming  victims  of  Cybercrime,  measures  to  increase  the  ability  to  combat  Cybercrime  should have high priority.
Strategies and especially legislation that is developed to address the challenges  of Cybercrime should on the one hand side be in line with international standards and on the other hand  side reflect the uniqueness of the region.
There  shall  be  provisions  covering  the  most  common  and  internationally  widely  accepted  forms  of  Cybercrime  as  well  as  those  offences  that  are  of  specific  interest  for  the  region  (such  as  for  example  SPAM).
To ensure the ability to cooperate with law enforcement agencies from countries in the region as well as  outside the region the legislation shall be compatible to both international standards and best practices as  well as (up to the largest extent possible) to existing regional standards and best practices.
This could include a list  of offences that should be covered, for example.
The level of detail could go down to details of provisions  that should be included in a cybercrime law.
Especially  in  this  respect  international  standards  should  be  taken  into  consideration.
The  legislation  should  in  addition  cover  the  criminalization  of  the  possession  of  child  pornography  and  gaining  access  to  child  pornography  websites.
An  exemption  that  enables  law  enforcement agencies to carry out investigations should be included.
Defining legal frameworks that require amendments, updates or changes   4.2.6  Introducing cybercrime legislation is not an easy task as there are various areas that require regulation.
In  addition to substantive criminal law and procedural law, cybercrime legislation may include issues related  to international cooperation, electronic evidence and the liability of an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
Provisions  related  to  cybercrime  do  not  necessarily  need  to  be  implemented  in  one  single  piece  of  legislation.
This  approach  of  implementing  cybercrime  legislation  by  a  process  of  respecting  existing  structures  is  certainly  more  challenging than  simply  implementing a  regional  standard  or  international  best  practice  word  by  word  in  a  standalone  piece  of  legislation.
The policy can be used to define the different components that should be integrated as well as identify  existing laws that require updates.
However,  crime  prevention  is  identified  as  a  key  component in an effective fight against cybercrime.902 Measures can range from technical solutions (such  as firewalls that prevent illegal access to a computer system and anti-virus software that can hinder the  installation of malicious software) to the blocking of access to illegal content.903    100   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     The  importance  of  crime  prevention  is  for  example  expressed  in  the  ICB4PAC904 Draft  Model  Policy  for  Cybercrime:   In addition to the criminalisation of Cybercrime and the improvement of the ability of law enforcement to  combat Cybercrime crime preventions measures need to be developed.
Within the process of developing  such measures, that can range from technical solutions to increasing user awareness, it is important to  identify those groups that require specific attention such as youth, technologically challenged people (such  as people from isolated villages that are technologically unaware) and women.
However, crime prevention  measures  should  also  apply  to  more  advanced  users  and  technology-affiliate  players  such  as  critical  infrastructure  provider  (such  as  the  tourism  or  financial  sector).
The  debate  about  necessary  measures  should include the whole range of instruments such as awareness raising, making available and promoting  free  of  charge  protection  technology  (such  as  anti-virus  software)  and  the  implementation  of  solutions  that enable parents to restrict the access to certain content.
Such measures should ideally be available at  the time of an introduction of a service/technology and maintained through out it’s operation.
To ensure a  wider reach of such measure a broad range of stakeholders should be involved that range from Internet  Service Provider to governments and regional bodies and explore various sources for funding.
From telecommunication regulation to ICT regulation    4.3.1  The  role  of  regulators  in  the  context  of  telecommunications  is  widely  recognized.905 As  Internet  has  eroded  the  old  models  of  the  division  of  responsibilities  between  government  and  private  sector,  a  transformation of the traditional role of ICT regulators and a change in the focus of ICT regulation can be  observed.906 Already  today  ICT  regulatory  authorities  find  themselves  involved  in  a  range  of  activities  linked  to  addressing  cybercrime.
This  is  especially  relevant  for  areas  like  content  regulation,  network  safety  and  consumer  protection,  as  users  have  become  vulnerable.907 The  involvement  of  regulators  is  therefore  the  result  of  the  fact  that  cybercrime  undermines  the  development  of  the  ICT  industry  and  related products and services.
In  some  countries,  ICT  regulators  have  already  explored  the  possibility  of  transferring  the  scope  of  regulatory  duties  from  competition  and  authorization  issues  within  the  telecom  industry  to  broader  consumer  protection,  industry  development,  cybersafety,  participation  in  cybercrime  policy- making  and  implementation,  which  includes  the  wider  use  of  ICTs  and  as  a  consequence  cybercrime- related  issues.
While  some  new  regulatory  authorities  have  been  created  with  mandates  and  responsibilities  that  include  cybercrime,908 older  established  ICT  regulators  have  extended  their  existing  tasks  to  include  various  activities  aimed  at  tackling  cyber-related  threats.909 However,  the  extent  and  limitations of such involvement are still under discussion.
Two traditional areas of involvement of regulators are consumer protection and network safety.
The  mandate 910  of  the  regulator  includes  Spam      101   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     prohibition911 and  preventing  the  dissemination  of  malware.912 During  the  debate  on  the  mandate  of  OPTA,  the  organization  expressed  the  view  that  a  bridge  should  be  built  between  cybersecurity  as  a  traditional field of activity and cybercrime in order to effectively address both issues.913 If cybercrime is  seen as a failure of cybersecurity, the mandate of regulators is consequently automatically expanded.
The  possibility  of  extending  the  regulator’s  mandate  to  include  cybercrime  issues  also  depends  on  the  institutional design of the regulator, and whether it is a multisector regulator (like utility commissions), a  sector-specific telecom regulator or a converged regulator.
While every model of institutional design has  its  advantages  and  disadvantages  from  the  perspective  of  ICT  industry  regulation914,  the  type  of  institutional design should be taken into account when assessing how and in what areas the ICT regulator  should  be  involved.
When  thinking  of  extending  the  interpretation  of  existing  mandates,  account  must  be  taken  of  the  capacity of the regulator and the need to avoid overlap with the mandates of other organizations.
The  Malaysian  Communications  and  Multimedia  Commission  (MCMC),  as  a  converged  regulator,  has  established  a  special  department 918  dealing  with  information  security  and  network  reliability,  the  integrity  of  communications  and  critical  communication  infrastructure.919 A  similar  approach  can  be  observed  in  South Korea, where in 2008 the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) was created by consolidating  the former Ministry of Information and Communication and the Korean Broadcasting Commission.
Among  other duties, KCC is responsible for the protection of Internet users from harmful or illegal content.920   Examples for involvement of regulators in fighting cybercrime   4.3.3  It is not only the model for defining the regulators’ mandate, but also the scope of action of ICT regulators  in this field that is not yet clearly defined.
Operating  in  a  rapidly  changing  and  developing  sector  exposes  ICT  regulators  to  new  areas  that  have  traditionally  been  considered as the domain of other government departments and agencies, or even no-one’s domain at  all.921 Even if the regulator possesses de facto sufficient competence and industry expertise to be involved  in  addressing  specific  cybercrime-related  issues,  a  clear  mandate  pinpointing  the  exact  areas  of  involvement is key for regulators to be effective.
The potential areas of involvement for regulators are  highlighted below:   Global policy strategies  The  principle  of  the  division  of  power  within  the  state 922  separates  policy-making  and  policy  implementation.923 Despite  the  importance  of  this  concept,  the  complexity  of  the  issue  may  require  regulators  to  be  involved  in  policy  advice.924 On  account  of  their  industry  expertise  and  existing  communication channels with other stakeholders, ICT regulators in many countries play an important role  in  determining  policies  and  strategies  for  ICT  industry  development.925 In  some  countries,  the  role  of  providing  inputs  to  ICT  policy-making  is  therefore  considered  as  one  of  the  main  tasks  of  the  ICT   102   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     regulator.926 While  this  common  practice  focuses  on  advice  on  telecommunication  issues,  the  mandate  could  be  extended  to  cybercrime.
In  Finland,  the  government  has  set  up  an  Advisory  Committee  for  Information  Security  (ACIS)  under  the  Finnish  Communications  Regulatory  Authority  (FICORA)  for  the  purpose  of  developing  their  national  information  strategy.
927 The  proposal  released  by  ACIS  in  2002  identifies  goals  and  measures  to  promote  the  information-security  strategy.
Several  measures  can  be  considered as cybercrime-related, and highlight the importance of developing and improving appropriate  legislation, international cooperation, and increasing information-security awareness among end-users.928    Involvement in the development of cybercrime legislation  The competent body to adopt legislation is the legislator, not a regulatory authority.
However, the ICT  regulator can play an important role in the process of developing cybercrime legislation.
In view of the  experience regulators possess in data protection, the confidentiality of data transmission, prevention of  the spreading of malicious software, other aspects of consumer protection and ISP responsibilities, their  involvement is especially discussed in those fields.929 In addition, criminal law is not an unknown field for  regulators,  since  in  many  countries  grave  violations  of  obligations  in  the  traditional  area  of  regulatory  work may be subject to criminal sanctions.
The  Ugandan Communications Commission, for example, was involved as adviser in the process of drafting  cybercrime  legislation.930 Moreover,  the  Ugandan  Communications  Commission,  through  the  Ugandan  National Task Force on cybercrime legislation, is now part of a regional initiative, called the East African  Countries’  Task  Force  on  Cyber  Laws,  which  is  dedicated  to  an  ongoing  process  of  development  and  harmonization  of  cybercrime  laws  in  the  East  African  region.
The  draft  was  developed  in  cooperation  with  the  Federal  Public  Service  of  Justice  and  the  Federal  Computer  Crime  Unit.935    Detecting and investigating cybercrime  Computer incident response teams (CIRTs) play an important role in monitoring, detecting, analysing and  investigating  cyberthreats  and  cyberincidents.
936 Due  to  the  multisector  nature  of  the  cybercrime  problem,  different  CIRTs  have  been  established  by  a  range  of  stakeholders,  including  governments,  businesses,  telecom  operators  and  academia,  to  fulfil  various  functions.937 In  some  countries,  ICT  regulators are responsible for creating and running national CIRTs.
These CIRTs are usually considered not  only as major entities in charge of detecting and investigating cybercrime incidents at the national level,  but also as key participants in actions to enhance cybercrime cooperation at the international level.
Some  countries have authorized ICT regulators to act as a law-enforcement agency in cybercrime-related areas  such as anti-spam, content regulation or enforcing co-regulatory measures.
With regard to Spam, some  European  ICT  regulators  are  already  part  of  a  contact  network  of  anti-spam  enforcement  authorities  established by the European Commission in 2004 to fight spam on a pan-European level.942 The OECD Task  Force  on  Spam  also  lists  ICT  regulators  as  contact  points  for  enforcement  agencies.943 Cooperation  agreements between ICT regulators and cybercrime units at the police level are also known to exist in the  Netherlands and Romania.944       103   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response   Legal measures     4.3.4  Of the five pillars of the Global Cybersecurity Agenda, legal measures are probably the most relevant with  regard to an anti-cybercrime strategy.
Substantive criminal law  This  requires  first  of  all  the  necessary  substantive  criminal-law  provisions  to  criminalize  acts  such  as  computer fraud, illegal access, data interference, copyright violations and child pornography.945 The fact  that  provisions  exist  in  the  criminal  code  that  are  applicable  to  similar  acts  committed  outside  the  network  does  not  mean  that  they  can  be  applied  to  acts  committed  over  the  Internet  as  well.946  Therefore, a thorough analysis of current national laws is vital to identify any possible gaps.947    Criminal procedural law  Apart  from  substantive  criminal-law  provisions,948 law-enforcement  agencies  need  the  necessary  tools  and  instruments  to  investigate  cybercrime.949 Such  investigations  themselves  present  a  number  of  challenges.950 Perpetrators can act from nearly any location in the world and take measures to mask their  identity.951 The tools and instruments needed to investigate cybercrime can be quite different from those  used to investigate ordinary crimes.952 Due to the international dimension953 of cybercrime it is in addition  necessary  to  develop  the  legal  national  framework  to  be  able  to  cooperate  with  law-enforcement  agencies abroad.954    Electronic evidence  When dealing with cybercrime the competent investigation authorities, as well as courts, need to deal  with electronic evidence.
Dealing with such evidence presents a number of challenges955 but also opens  up  new  possibilities  for  investigation  and  for  the  work  of  forensic  experts  and  courts.956 In  those  cases  where  no  other  sources  of  evidence  are  available,  the  ability  to  successfully  identify  and  prosecute  an  offender may depend upon the correct collection and evaluation of electronic evidence.957 This influences  the  way  law-enforcement  agencies  and  courts  deal  with  such  evidence.958 While  traditional  documents  are  introduced  by  handing  out  the  original  document  in  court,  digital  evidence  in  some  cases  requires  specific procedures that do not allow conversion into traditional evidence, e.g.
International cooperation  Due to the transnational dimension of the Internet and the globalization of services, an increasing number  of  cybercrimes  have  an  international  dimension.960 Countries  that  desire  to  cooperate  with  other  countries in investigating cross-border crime will need to use instruments of international cooperation.961  Taking into account the mobility of offenders, the independence from presence of the offender and the  impact  of  the  offence  shows  the  challenge  and  the  need  for  a  collaboration  of  law-enforcement  and  judicial  authorities.
962  Due  to  differences  international  cooperation  is  considered  to  be  one  of  the  major  challenges  of  a  globalization  of  crime.963 Within  a  comprehensive approach to address cybercrime, countries need to consider strengthening their ability to  cooperate with other countries and making the procedure more efficient.
instruments,   limited   in  national   law  and   Liability of service provider  Cybercrime can hardly be committed without the use of the services of an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
E-Mails with threatening content are sent by using the service of an e-mail provider and illegal content  downloaded from a website involves among others the service of a Hosting Provider and Access Provider.
As a consequence, ISPs are often in the centre of criminal investigations involving offenders who use the  ISPs’ services to commit an offence.964 Taking into account that on the one hand, cybercrime cannot be  committed without the involvement of ISPs but on the other hand, providers often do not have the ability   104   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     to prevent these crimes, led to the question of whether the responsibility of Internet providers needs to  be limited.965 This issue may be addressed within a comprehensive legal approach to cybercrime.
Technical and procedural measures   4.3.5  Cybercrime-related  investigations  very  often  have  a  strong  technical  component.966 In  addition,  the  requirement to maintain the integrity of the evidence during an investigation calls for precise procedures.
The development of the necessary capacities as well as procedures is therefore a necessary requirement  in the fight against cybercrime.
Another issue is the development of technical protection systems.
Improving technical protection by implementing proper security standards is an  important first step.
the switch from TAN967 to  ITAN968) have eliminated much of the danger posed by current “phishing” attacks, demonstrating the vital  importance  of  technical  solutions.969 Technical  protection  measures  should  include  all  elements  of  the  technical  infrastructure  –  the  core  network  infrastructure,  as  well  as  the  many  individually  connected  computers  worldwide.
Two  potential  target  groups  can  be  identified  for  protecting  Internet  users  and  businesses: end users and businesses (direct approach) and service providers and software companies.
backbone network, routers,  essential  services),  rather  than  integrating  millions  of  users  into  an  anti-cybercrime  strategy.
User  protection  can  be  achieved  indirectly,  by  securing  the  services  consumers  use,  such  as  online  banking.
This indirect approach to protecting Internet users can reduce the number of people and institutions that  need to be included in steps to promote technical protection.
Although  limiting  the  number  of  people  that  need  to  be  included  in  technical  protection  might  seem  desirable, computer and Internet users are often the weakest link and the main target of criminals.
It is  often easier to attack private computers to obtain sensitive information, rather than the well-protected  computer  systems  of  a  financial  institution.
Despite  the  logistical  problems,  the  protection  of  end-user  infrastructure is vital for the technical protection of the whole network.
Internet service providers and product vendors (e.g.
Due to their direct contact with clients, they can operate as a guarantor of  security activities (e.g.
the distribution of protection tools and information on the current status of most  recent scams).970    Organizational structures  An effective fight against cybercrime requires highly developed organizational structures.
Without having  the  right  structures  in  place,  ones  that  avoid  overlapping  and  are  based  on  clear  competences,  it  will  hardly be possible to carry out complex investigations that require the assistance of different legal as well  as technical experts.
In order to be able to investigate offences effectively, laws need to  be harmonized and means of international cooperation need to be developed.
In order to ensure global  standards in both the developed and the developing countries, capacity building is necessary.971   In  addition  to  capacity  building,  user  education  is  required.972 Certain  cybercrimes  –  especially  those  related  to  fraud,  such  as  “phishing”  and  “spoofing”  –  do  not  generally  depend  on  a  lack  of  technical  protection,  but  rather  on a  lack  of awareness  on  the  part  of  the  victims.973 There  are  various  software  products  that  can  automatically  identify  fraudulent  websites,974 but  until  now  these  products  cannot  identify all suspicious websites.
A user-protection strategy based only on software products has limited  ability  to  protect  users.975 Although  technical  protection  measures  continue  to  develop  and  available  products are updated on a regular basis, such products cannot yet substitute for other approaches.
The  education  of  Internet users reduces the number of potential targets.
One important requirement of an efficient education and information strategy is open communication of  the  latest  cybercrime  threats.
The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation has explicitly asked companies  to overcome their aversion to negative publicity and report cybercrime.977 In order to determine threat  levels,  as  well  as  to  inform  users,  it  is  vital  to  improve  the  collection  and  publication  of  relevant  information.978    International cooperation   In many cases, data-transfer processes in the Internet affect more than one country.979 This is a result of  the design of the network, and the fact that the protocols ensure that successful transmissions can be  made, even if direct lines are temporarily blocked.980 In addition, a large number of Internet services (like  for example hosting services) are offered by companies that are based abroad.981   In  those  cases  where  the  offender  is  not  based  in  the  same  country  at  the  victim,  the  investigation  requires cooperation between law-enforcement agencies in all the countries affected.982 International and  transnational investigations without the consent of the competent authorities in the countries involved  are difficult in regard to the principle of national sovereignty.
This is due to the  fact  that  mutual  legal  assistance  in  general  requires  time-consuming  formal  procedures.
As  a  result,  improvement in terms of enhanced international cooperation plays an important and critical role in the  development and implementation of cybersecurity strategies and anti-cybercrime strategies.

The  following  chapter  will  provide  an  overview  of  international  legislative  approaches 984 and  the  relationship with national approaches.
available   International approaches   5.1  A  number  of  international  organizations  work  constantly  to  analyse  the  latest  developments  in  cybercrime and have set up working groups to develop strategies to fight these crimes.
The G8985   5.1.1  In 1997, the Group of Eight (G8) established a “Subcommittee986 on High-tech Crimes”, dealing with the  fight  against  cybercrime.987 During  their  meeting  in  Washington  DC,  United  States,  the  G8  Justice  and  Home Affairs Ministers adopted ten Principles and a Ten-Point Action Plan to fight high-tech crimes.988 The  Heads of the G8 subsequently endorsed these principles, which include:    •  There must be no safe havens for those who abuse information technologies.
•   Investigation and prosecution of international  high-tech crimes must be coordinated among all  concerned states, regardless of where harm has occurred.
•   114   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     In  1999,  the  G8  specified  their  plans  regarding  the  fight  against  high-tech  crimes  at  a  Ministerial  Conference  on  Combating  Transnational  Organized  Crimes  in  Moscow,  Russian  Federation.989 They  expressed their concerns about crimes (such as child pornography), as well as traceability of transactions  and  transborder  access  to  stored  data.
Their  communiqué  contains  a  number  of  principles  in  the  fight  against cybercrime that are today found in a number of international strategies.990   One of the practical achievements of the work done by expert groups has been the development of an  international 24/7-network of contacts requiring participating countries to establish points of contact for  transnational investigations that are accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.991   At the G8 Conference in Paris, France in 2000, the G8 addressed the topic of cybercrime with a call to  prevent  lawless  digital  havens.
Already  at  that  time,  the  G8  connected  its  attempts  for  international  solutions to the Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime (the “Convention on Cybercrime”).992 In  2001,  the  G8  discussed  procedural  instruments  in  the  fight  against  cybercrime  at  a  workshop  held  in  Tokyo,993 focusing  on  whether  data-retention  obligations  should  be  implemented  or  whether  data  preservation was an alternative solution.994   In 2004, the G8 Justice and Home Affairs Ministers issued a communiqué in which they addressed the  need for the creation of global capacities in the fight against criminal uses of the Internet.
995 Again, the  G8 took note of the Convention.996   During the 2006 meeting in Moscow, the G8 Justice and Home Affairs Ministers discussed issues related  to the fight against cybercrime and the issues of cyberspace, and especially the necessity of improving  effective counter-measures.997 The meeting of the G8 Justice and Home Affairs Ministers was followed by  the G8 Summit in Moscow, where the issue of cyberterrorism998 was discussed.999   During the 2007 meeting the of the G8 Justice and Interior Ministers in Munich, Germany, the issue of  terrorist use of the Internet was further discussed and the participants agreed to criminalize the misuse of  the  Internet  by  terrorist  groups.1000 This  agreement  did  not  include  specific  acts  that  the  states  should  criminalize.
The  final  declaration  states  that,  in  the  view  of  G8,  blocking  of  child  pornography websites on the basis of blacklists updated and disseminated by international organizations  should  be  implemented.1001 With  regard  to  cybercrime  in  general,  the  final  declaration  highlights  an  increasing threat and points out that closer cooperation between service providers and law enforcement  is  necessary  and  that  existing  forms  of  cooperation,  such  as  the  G8  24/7  High-Tech  Crime  Points  of  Contact, need to be strengthened.1002   At the G8 Summit in Muskoka, Canada, cybercrime was only briefly discussed.
The Muskoka Declaration  only  states  in  the  context  of  terrorist  activities  that  the  G8  is  concerned  about  the  growing  threat  of  cybercrime and will intensify work to weaken terrorist and criminal networks.1003  Cybercrime and Cybersecurity were issues that were both discusses at the e-G8 Forum, where delegations  discussed Internet-related topics with business leader1004 as well as the G8 summit in Deauville, France.
The G8 only agreed to general principles such as  the importance of security and protection from crime that underpin a strong and flourishing Internet.1005    5.1.2  United Nations and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes1006  The United Nations has undertaken several important approaches to address the challenge of cybercrime.
While in the beginning its response was limited to general guidelines, the organization has in recent times  dealt more intensively with the challenges and legal response.
UN General Assembly Resolution 45/121  After  the  eighth  United  Nations  Congress  on  the  Prevention  of  Crime  and  the  Treatment  of  Offenders  (held in Havana, Cuba, 27 August – 7 September 1990), the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution  dealing  with  computer-crime  legislation.1008 Based  on  its  Resolution  45/121  (1990),  the  UN  published  a  manual in 1994 on the prevention and control of computer-related crime.1009    Optional  Protocol  to  the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  on  the  Sale  of  Children,  Child  Prostitution and Child Pornography  The Optional Protocol not only addresses the issue of child pornography in general, but explicitly refers to  the  role  of  the  Internet  in  distributing  such  material.
1010  Child  pornography  is  defined  as  any  representation, by whatever means, of a child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual activities or any  representation of the sexual parts of a child for primarily sexual purposes.1011 Article 3 requires the parties  to criminalize certain conduct – including acts related to child pornography.
Each  State  Party  shall ensure that,  as  a  minimum, the  following acts  and  activities  are  fully covered  under its criminal or penal law, whether these offences are committed domestically or transnationally or  on an individual or organized basis:  [...]     (c)  Producing,  distributing,  disseminating,  importing,  exporting,  offering,  selling  or  possessing  for  the above purposes child pornography as defined in Article 2.
[...]   Tenth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders   During the tenth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders,  held in Vienna in 2000, the impact of computer-related crimes was discussed in a specific workshop.1012  The debate focused especially on the categories of crime and transnational investigation, as well as legal  response to the phenomenon.1013 The conclusions of the workshop contain major elements of the debate  that  is  still  ongoing:  criminalization  is  required,  legislation  needs  to  include  procedural  instruments,  international cooperation is crucial and public-private partnership should be strengthened.1014 In addition,  the importance of capacity building was highlighted – an issue that was picked up again in subsequent  years.1015 The Vienna Declaration called upon the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to  undertake work in this regard:     18.
We  decide  to  develop  action-oriented  policy  recommendations  on  the  prevention  and  control  of  computer-  related  crime,  and  we  invite  the  Commission  on  Crime  Prevention  and  Criminal  Justice  to  undertake  work  in  this  regard,  taking  into  account  the  ongoing  work  in  other  forums.
We  also  commit  ourselves to working towards enhancing our ability to prevent, investigate and prosecute high-technology  and computer-related crime.
UN General Assembly Resolution 55/63  In the same year, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on combating the criminal misuse of  information technologies which displays a number of similarities with the G8’s Ten-Point Action Plan from  1997.1016 In its resolution, the General Assembly identified a number of measures to prevent the misuse of  information technology, including:      116   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     States should ensure that their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse  information technologies;   Law  enforcement  cooperation  in  the  investigation  and  prosecution  of  international  cases  of  criminal  misuse of information technologies should be coordinated among all concerned States;   Law enforcement personnel should be trained and equipped to address the criminal misuse of information  technologies;     Resolution  55/63  invites  States  to  take  the  necessary  steps  to  combat  cybercrime  on  the  regional  and  international  stage.
This  includes  the  development  of  domestic  legislation  to  eliminate  safe  havens  for  criminal misuse of technologies, improving law-enforcement capacities to cooperate across borders in the  investigation  and  prosecution  of  international  cases  of  criminal  misuse  of  information  technologies,  improving  information  exchange,  enhancing  the  security  of  data  and  computer  systems,  training  law  enforcement  to  deal  specifically  with  the  challenges  associated  with  cybercrime,  building  mutual  assistance regimes and raising public awareness of the threat of cybercrime.
UN General Assembly Resolution 56/121  In  2002,  the  UN  General  Assembly  adopted  another  resolution  on  combating  the  criminal  misuse  of  information  technology.1017 The  resolution  refers  to  the  existing  international  approaches  in  fighting  cybercrime and highlights various solutions.
Noting the work of international and regional organizations in combating high-technology crime, including  the work of the Council of Europe in elaborating the Convention on Cybercrime as well as the work of those  organizations in promoting dialogue between government and the private sector on safety and confidence  in cyberspace,   1.
Invites Member States, when developing national law, policy and practice to combat the criminal misuse  of  information  technologies,  to  take  into  account,  as  appropriate,  the  work  and  achievements  of  the  Commission  on  Crime  Prevention  and  Criminal  Justice  and  of  other  international  and  regional  organizations;   2.
Takes note of the value of the measures set forth in its resolution 55/63, and again invites Member  States  to  take  them  into  account  in  their  efforts  to  combat  the  criminal  misuse  of  information  technologies;   3.
Decides to defer consideration of this subject,  pending work envisioned in the plan of action against  high-technology and computer-related crime of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice    Resolution 56/121 underlines the need for cooperation among states in combating the criminal misuse of  information  technologies.
It  highlights  the  role  that  can  be  played  by  the  United  Nations  and  other  international  and  regional  organizations.
The  resolution  further  invites  states  to  take  into  account  the  direction provided by the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice when developing national  legislation.
UN General Assembly Resolutions 57/239 and 58/199  Resolutions  57/239  and  58/199  are  the  two  main  UN  General  Assembly  resolutions  dealing  with  cybersecurity.
Both  resolutions  furthermore  emphasize  the  need  for  international  cooperation  in  fighting  cybercrime by recognizing that gaps in states’ access to and use of information technologies can diminish  the  effectiveness  of  international  cooperation  in  combating  the  criminal  misuse  of  information  technology.1018   Eleventh UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice  Cybercrime was discussed during the eleventh UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (the  “UN Crime Congress”) in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2005.
Several challenges associated with the emerging use  of computer systems in committing offences and the transnational dimension were addressed both in the      117   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     background paper1019 and in workshops.1020 Within the framework of the preparatory meetings in advance  of  the  congress,  some  member  countries  such  as  Egypt  called  for  a  new  UN  convention  against  cybercrime,  and  the  Western  Asian  regional  preparatory  meeting  called  for  the  negotiation  of  such  convention.1021 The  possibility  of  negotiating  a  convention  was  included  in  the  discussion  guide  for  the  eleventh UN Crime Congress.1022 However, the Member States could at this time not decide to initiate a  harmonization  of  legislation.
We  note  that,  in  the  current  period  of  globalization,  information  technology  and  the  rapid  development of new telecommunication and computer network systems have been accompanied by the  abuse  of  those  technologies  for  criminal  purposes.
We  therefore  welcome  efforts  to  enhance  and  supplement  existing  cooperation  to  prevent,  investigate  and  prosecute  high-technology  and  computer- related crime, including by developing partnerships with the private sector.
We recognize the important  contribution  of  the  United  Nations  to  regional  and  other  international  forums  in  the  fight  against  cybercrime and invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, taking into account that  experience, to examine the feasibility of providing further assistance in that area under the aegis of the  United Nations in partnership with other similarly focused organizations.
UN General Assembly Resolution 60/177  After the eleventh UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2005, a  declaration was adopted that highlighted the need for harmonization in the fight against cybercrime,1023  addressing, among others, the following issues:   international  cooperation   We  reaffirm  the  fundamental  importance  of  implementation  of  existing  instruments  and  the  further  development  of  national  measures  and  in  criminal  matters,  such  as  consideration  of  strengthening  and  augmenting  measures,  in  particular  against  cybercrime,  money- laundering and trafficking in cultural property, as well as on extradition, mutual legal assistance and the  confiscation, recovery and return of proceeds of crime.
We note that, in the current period of globalization, information technology and the rapid development of  new telecommunication and computer network systems have been accompanied by the abuse of those  technologies  for  criminal  purposes.
We  therefore  welcome  efforts  to  enhance  and  supplement  existing  cooperation to prevent investigate and prosecute high-technology and computer-related crime, including  by developing partnerships with the private sector.
We recognize the important contribution of the United  Nations  to  regional  and  other  international  forums  in  the  fight  against  cybercrime  and  invite  the  Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, taking into account that experience, to examine the  feasibility of providing further assistance in that area under the aegis of the United Nations in partnership  with other similarly focused organizations.
UN  General  Assembly  Resolution  60/177  endorsed  the  2005  Bangkok  Declaration,  wherein  the  international community’s efforts to enhance and supplement existing cooperation to prevent computer- related  crime  were  encouraged,  inviting  further  exploration  of  the feasibility  of  providing  assistance  to  Member  States  in  addressing  computer-related  crime  under  the  aegis  of  the  United  Nations,  and  in  partnership with other similarly focused organizations.
Twelfth UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice  The topic of cybercrime was also discussed at the twelfth UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal  Justice held in Brazil in 2010.1024 Within the four regional preparatory meetings for the congress, for Latin  America and Caribbean,1025 Western Asia,1026 Asia and the Pacific1027 and Africa,1028 the countries called for  the  development  of  an  international  convention  on  cybercrime.
The  fact  that  the  delegations  discussed  the  topics  for  two  days  and  that  additional  side  events  were  organized  highlights  the   118   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     importance  of  the  topic,  which  was  more  intensively  discussed  than  during  the  previous  crime  congresses.1030 The deliberations focused on two main issues: how can harmonization of legal standards  be  achieved,  and  how  can  developing  countries  be  supported  in  fighting  cybercrime?
The  first  point  is  especially  relevant  if  the  UN  develops  comprehensive  legal  standards  or  suggests  that  Member  States  implement the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.
We  recommend  that  the  United  Nations  Office  on  Drugs  and  Crime,  upon  request,  provide,  in  cooperation  with  Member  States,  relevant  international  organizations  and  the  private  sector,  technical  assistance  and  training  to  States  to  improve  national  legislation  and  build  the  capacity  of  national  authorities,  in  order  to  deal  with  cybercrime,  including  the  prevention,  detection,  investigation  and  prosecution of such crime in all its forms, and to enhance the security of computer networks.
We invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to consider convening an open- ended intergovernmental expert group to conduct a comprehensive study of the problem of cybercrime  and responses to it by Member States, the international community and the private sector, including the  exchange  of  information  on  national  legislation,  best  practices,  technical  assistance  and  international  cooperation, with a view to examining options to strengthen existing and to propose new national and  international legal or other responses to cybercrime.
Taking  into  account  UNODC’s  experience  in  capacity  building  related  to  criminal  legislation  and  the  fact  that,  unlike  the  Council  of  Europe, UNODC provides a global network of regional offices, it is likely that UN through UNODC will play  a more important role in this field in the future.
The second recommendation highlights that, at the time of the UN Crime Congress, Member States were  unable to decide whether to develop a legal text or not.
This reflects the controversial discussion during  the congress, where those European countries that have already ratified the Convention on Cybercrime,  in particular, expressed their support for that instrument while a number of developing countries called  for  a  UN  convention.
This  time  they  did  not  refer  to  existing  instruments  and,  even  more  importantly,  they  did  not  decide  to  recommend  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime as a global standard.
Instead, the Member States recommended to invite the Commission on  Crime  Prevention  and  Criminal  Justice  to  conduct  a  comprehensive  study,  which  should,  inter  alia,  examine options for strengthening existing and proposing new national and international legal or other  responses to cybercrime.
UN General Assembly Resolution 64/211  In March 2010, the UN General Assembly passed a new resolution1032 as part of the “Creation of a global  culture  of  cybersecurity”  initiative.
Resolution  64/211  refers  to  the  two  major  resolutions  on  cybercrime1033 as well as the two main resolutions on cybersecurity.1034 The voluntary self-assessment tool  for national efforts to protect critical information infrastructures provided as an annex to the resolution  calls for countries to review and update legal authorities (including those related to cybercrime, privacy,  data protection, commercial law, digital signatures and encryption) that may be outdated or obsolete as a  result of the rapid uptake of, and dependence upon, new information and communication technologies.
The  resolution  further  calls  on  states  to  use  regional  international  conventions,  arrangements  and  precedents in these reviews.
119   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     13. Review and update legal authorities (including those related to cybercrime, privacy, data protection,  commercial law, digital signatures and encryption) that may be outdated or obsolete as a result of the  rapid  uptake  of  and  dependence  upon  new  information  and  communications  technologies,  and  use  regional and international conventions, arrangements and precedents in these reviews.
Ascertain whether  your  country  has  developed  necessary  legislation  for  the  investigation  and  prosecution  of  cybercrime,  noting existing frameworks, for example, General Assembly resolutions 55/63 and 56/121 on combating  the criminal misuse of information technologies, and regional initiatives, including the Council of Europe  Convention on Cybercrime.
Determine  the  current  status  of  national  cybercrime  authorities  and  procedures,  including  legal  authorities and national cybercrime units, and the level of understanding among prosecutors, judges and  legislators of cybercrime issues.
Examine national participation in international efforts to combat cybercrime, such as the round-the- clock Cybercrime Point of Contact Network.
Determine the requirements for national law enforcement agencies to cooperate with international  counterparts to investigate transnational cybercrime in those instances in which infrastructure is situated  or perpetrators reside in national territory, but victims reside elsewhere.
The fact that four out of 18 subjects of the self-assessment tool are related to cybercrime highlights the  importance  of  the  ability  of  law  enforcement  to  combat  cybercrime  effectively  for  maintaining  cybersecurity.
Intergovernmental Expert Group on Cybercrime  Following the decision of the Member States to call upon UNODC to set up an intergovernmental working  group, the first meeting of the group was held in Vienna in January 2011.1035 The expert group included  representatives  of  Member  States,  intergovernmental  and  international  organizations,  specialized  agencies, private sector and academia.
During the meeting the members of the expert group discussed a  draft structure for a comprehensive study analysing the issue of cybercrime, as well as the response.1036  With  regard  to  the  legal  response,  a  number  of  members  underline  the  usefulness  of  existing  international legal instruments, including the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized  Crime (UNTOC) and the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, and the desirability of elaborating a  global legal instrument to address specifically the problem of cybercrime.
It was agreed that the decision  on whether a global instrument should be developed will be made after the study was conducted.
Other resolutions and activities  In  addition,  a  number  of  United  Nations  system  decisions,  resolutions  and  recommendations  address  issues related to cybercrime, the most important being the following: the United Nations Office for Drugs  and  Crime  (UNODC)  and  the  Commission  on  Crime  Prevention  and  Criminal  Justice1037 adopted  a  resolution on effective crime prevention and criminal justice responses to combat sexual exploitation of  children.1038 In  2004,  the  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Council1039 adopted  a  resolution  on  international  cooperation  in  the  prevention,  investigation,  prosecution  and  punishment  of  fraud,  the  criminal  misuse  and  falsification  of  identity  and  related  crimes.1040 A  working  group  was  established  in  2005.1041 A  core  group  of  experts  on  identity-related  crime  was  created  to  undertake  a  comprehensive  study  on  the  issue.
In  2007,  the  ECOSOC  adopted  a  resolution  on  international  cooperation  in  the  prevention, investigation, prosecution and punishment of economic fraud and identity-related crime.1042  Neither of these two resolutions explicitly addresses the challenges of Internet-related crimes,1043 but they  are applicable to those offences as well.
Based on ECOSOC Resolution 2004/261044 and ECOSOC Resolution  2007/20,1045 UNODC in 2007 established a core group of experts to exchange views on the best course of  action.1046 The  core  group  has  undertaken  several  studies  that  included  aspects  of  Internet-related  crimes.1047 In  2004,  ECOSOC  had  adopted  a  resolution  on  the  sale  of  licit  drugs  via  the  Internet  that  explicitly took account of a phenomenon related to a computer crime.1048    120   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     UNODC/ITU Memorandum of Understanding  In  2011  UNODC  and  the  International  Telecommunication  Union  (ITU)  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  related  to  cybercrime.1049 The  MoU  covers  cooperation  (especially  capacity  building  and  technical assistance for developing countries), training and joint workshops.
With regard to the capacity  building  activities  the  two  organizations  can  refer  to  a  wide  network  of  field  offices  in  all  continents.
Further more the organizations agreed to a joined dissemination of information and knowledge and data  analysis.
International Telecommunication Union1050   5.1.3  The  International  Telecommunication  Union  (ITU),  as  a  specialized  agency  within  the  United  Nations,  plays  a  leading  role  in  the  standardization  and  development  of  telecommunications  as  well  as  cybersecurity issues.
World Summit on the Information Society  Among other activities, ITU was the lead agency of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS)  that took place in two phases in Geneva, Switzerland (2003) and in Tunis, Tunisia (2005).
Governments,  policy-makers  and  experts  from  around  the  world  shared  ideas  and  experiences  about  how  best  to  address the emerging issues associated with of the development of a global information society, including  the  development  of  compatible  standards  and  laws.
The  outputs  of  the  Summit  are  contained  in  the  Geneva Declaration of Principles, the Geneva Plan of Action; the Tunis Commitment and the Tunis Agenda  for the Information Society.
The Geneva Plan of Action highlights the importance of measures in the fight against cybercrime:1051     C5.Building confidence and security in the use of ICTs  12.
Confidence and security are among the main pillars of the Information Society.
Governments,  in  cooperation  with  the  private  sector,  should  prevent,  detect  and  respond  to  cyber-crime and misuse of ICTs by: developing guidelines that take into account ongoing efforts in  these  areas;  considering  legislation  that  allows  for  effective  investigation  and  prosecution  of  misuse;  promoting  effective  mutual  assistance  efforts;  strengthening  institutional  support  at  the  international level for preventing, detecting and recovering from such incidents; and encouraging  education and raising awareness.
The Tunis Agenda for the  Information  Society1052 highlights  the  need for  international  cooperation  in  the  fight  against  cybercrime  and  refers  to  the  existing  legislative  approaches  such  as  the  UN  General  Assembly  resolutions  and  the  Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime:     40.
We underline the importance of the prosecution of cybercrime, including cybercrime committed in one  jurisdiction,  but  having  effects  in  another.
We  further  underline  the  necessity  of  effective  and  efficient  tools and actions, at national and international levels, to promote international cooperation among, inter  alia,  law-enforcement  agencies  on  cybercrime.
We  call  upon  governments  in  cooperation  with  other  stakeholders to develop necessary legislation for the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime, noting  existing  frameworks,  for  example,  UNGA  Resolutions  55/63  and  56/121  on  “Combating  the  criminal  misuse of information technologies” and regional initiatives including, but not limited to, the Council of  Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime.
121   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Global Cybersecurity Agenda  As an outcome of WSIS, ITU was nominated as the sole facilitator for Action Line C5 dedicated to building  of  confidence  and  security in  the  use  of information  and  communication  technology.1053 At  the  second  Facilitation  Meeting  for  WSIS  Action  Line  C5  in  2007,  the  ITU  Secretary-General  highlighted  the  importance of international cooperation in the fight against cybercrime and announced the launch of the  ITU Global Cybersecurity Agenda.1054 The Global Cybersecurity Agenda is made up of seven key goals,1055  and  built  upon  five  strategic  pillars1056,  including  the  elaboration  of  strategies  for  the  development  of  model cybercrime legislation.
The seven goals are the following:    1  Elaboration  of  strategies  for  the  development  of  a  model  cybercrime  legislation  that  is  globally  applicable and interoperable with existing national and regional legislative measures.
3  Development  of  a  strategy  for  the  establishment  of  globally  accepted  minimum  security  criteria  and  accreditation schemes for software applications and systems.
4  Development  of  strategies  for  the  creation  of  a  global  framework  for  watch,  warning  and  incident  response to ensure cross-border coordination between new and existing initiatives.
5 Development of strategies for the creation and endorsement of a generic and universal digital identity  system  and  the  necessary  organizational  structures  to  ensure  the  recognition  of  digital  credentials  for  individuals across geographical boundaries.
6  Development  of  a  global  strategy  to  facilitate  human  and  institutional  capacity-building  to  enhance  knowledge and know-how across sectors and in all the above-mentioned areas.
7  Advice  on  potential  framework  for  a  global  multi-stakeholder  strategy  for  international  cooperation,  dialogue and coordination in all the above-mentioned areas.
In order to analyse and develop measure and strategies with regard to the seven goals of the GCA, the ITU  Secretary-General  created  a  high-level  expert  group  (HLEG)  bringing  together  representatives  from  Member  States,  industry  as  well  as  the  scientific  field.
1057 In  2008,  the  expert  group  concluded  negotiations and published the “Global Strategic Report”.1058 Most relevant with regard to cybercrime are  the  legal  measures  contained  in  Chapter 1.
In  addition  to  an  overview  of  different  regional  and  international  approaches  in  fighting  cybercrime,1059 the  chapter  provides  an  overview  of  criminal  law  provisions,1060 procedural  instruments,1061 regulations  governing  the  responsibility  of  Internet  service  providers1062 and safeguards to protect fundamental rights of Internet users.1063    Capacity building  Under  the  umbrella  of  the  ITU  GCA,  ITU-D  works  to  assist  countries  in  implementing  harmonized  cybersecurity-related activities at the national, regional and international level.
Based  on  the  resolution,  ITU  has  the  mandate  to  assist  Member  States,  in  particular  developing  countries,  in  the  elaboration  of  appropriate  and  workable  legal  measures  relating  to  protection against cyberthreats.
This  includes  capacity-building  activities  in  the  development  of  national  strategies,  legislation  and  enforcement, organizational structures (e.g.
ITU has organized several regional conferences which have specifically addressed, inter alia, the issue of  cybercrime.
1064 Together  with  partners  from  the  public  and  private  sectors,  ITU-D  has  developed  cybersecurity/CIIP  tools  to  assist  Member  States  in  raising  national  awareness,  conducting  national  cybersecurity self-assessments, revising legislation and expanding watch, warning and incident-response  capabilities.
These  tools  include  Understanding  Cybercrime:  A  Guide  for  Developing  Countries,  the  ITU  National Cybersecurity/CIIP Self-Assessment Tool and the ITU Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.

Regional approaches   5.2  In  addition  to  the  international  organizations  that  are  globally  active,  a  number  of  international  organizations that focus of specific regions have move forward on activities that deal with issues related  to cybercrime.
Activities until 1995  In  1976,  the  Council  of  Europe  highlighted  the  international  nature  of  computer-related  crimes  and  discussed  the  topic  at  a  conference  dealing  with  aspects  of  economic  crimes.
This  topic  has  since  remained on its agenda.1066 In 1985, the Council of Europe appointed an Expert Committee1067 to discuss  the legal aspects of computer crimes.1068 In 1989, the European Committee on Crime Problems adopted  the  “Expert  Report  on  Computer-Related  Crime”,1069 analysing  the  substantive  criminal  legal  provisions  necessary to fight new forms of electronic crimes, including computer fraud and forgery.
The Committee  of Ministers in 1989 adopted a recommendation1070 that specifically highlighted the international nature  of computer crime:     The  Committee  of  Ministers,  under  the  terms  of  Article  15.b  of  the  Statute  of  the  Council  of  Europe,  Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members;  Recognising the importance of an adequate and quick response to the new challenge of computer-related  crime; Considering that computer-related crime often has a transfrontier character; Aware of the resulting  need for further harmonisation of the law and practice, and for improving international legal co-operation,  Recommends the governments of member states to :     1.
Report to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe during 1993 on any developments in  their legislation, judicial practice and experiences of international legal co-operation in respect of  computer-related crime.
1071 Guidelines  for  the  drafting  of  adequate  legislation  were  summarized in the Appendix to the Recommendation.1072    Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and the Additional Protocol  The European Committee on Crime Problems (CDPC) decided in 1996 to set up a committee of experts to  deal with cybercrime.1073 The idea of going beyond principles for another recommendation and drafting a  convention was present at the time of the establishment of the Committee of Experts.1074 Between 1997  and 2000, the committee held ten meetings in plenary and fifteen meetings of its open-ended Drafting  Group.
The  Assembly  adopted  the  draft  Convention  on  Cybercrime  in  the  second  part  of  its  plenary  session in April 2001.1075 The finalized draft Convention was submitted for approval to CDPC and to the  Committee  of  Ministers  for  adoption  and  opening  for  signature.1076 The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  was  opened for signature at a signing ceremony in Budapest on 23 November 2001, during which 30 countries  signed the Convention on Cybercrime (including four non-members of the Council of Europe – Canada,  United States, Japan and South Africa – that participated in the negotiations).
In  the  meantime seven states were invited to accede to the Convention on Cybercrime, but have not done so.1080  The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  is  today  recognized  as  an  important  regional  instrument  in  the  fight  against cybercrime and is supported by different international organizations.1081   The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  was  followed  by  the  First  Additional  Protocol  to  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime.1082 During the negotiations on the text of the Convention on Cybercrime, it turned out that  the criminalization of racism and the distribution of xenophobic material were particularly controversial  matters.1083 Some  countries  in  which  the  principle  of  freedom  of  expression1084 was  strongly  protected  expressed  their  concern  that  if  provisions  are  included  in  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  that  violate  freedom of expression they would be unable to sign the Convention.1085 In the fourth draft version from  1998,  the  Convention  still  included  a  provision  that  required  the  parties  to  criminalize  illegal  content  “concerning  in  particular  matters  such  as  child  pornography  and  racial  hatred”.1086 To  avoid  a  situation  where countries would not be able to sign the Convention because of freedom of expression concerns,  those  issues  were  removed  from  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  during  the  drafting  process  and  integrated  into  a  separate  protocol.
Debate about the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime  Currently, the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime is still the instrument with the broadest reach  supported by different international organizations.1089 However, the debate in the twelfth Crime Congress  highlighted that ten years after its opening for signature, the impact of the Convention is limited.1090    Limitation of reach of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime  As of Januar 2011, the United States is the only country outside Europe that has ratified the instrument.
It  is  true  that  the  impact  of  the  Convention  cannot  be  measured  solely  by  the  number  of  signatures  or  ratifications,  since  countries  such  as  Argentina,1091 Pakistan,1092 Philippines,1093 Egypt,1094 Botswana1095 and  Nigeria1096 have used the Convention as a model and drafted parts of their legislation in accordance with  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  without  formally  acceding  to  it.
Some  of them have also used other law texts, such as the EU Directive on Attacks against Information Systems  and the Commonwealth Model Law.
Since those laws display a number of similarities to the Convention  on  Cybercrime  and,  in  addition,  provisions  have  very  rarely  been  reproduced  word  for  word,  but  have   124   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     been adjusted to the countries’ requirements, this makes it nearly impossible to determine if and to what  extent a country has used the Convention as a guideline.
The Council of Europe does not disclose the  names of the countries concerned, and only refers to an “internal list”.
The  rather  vague  information  published  by  the  Council  of  Europe  also  leaves  open  the  question of whether all provisions from the Convention on Cybercrime have been implemented, or only  one.
As slow as  the ratification process is the implementation process.
No evaluation of the ratification  The  Council  of  Europe  has  so  far  never  evaluated  whether  those  countries  that  have  submitted  their  ratification instrument have actually implemented the Convention on Cybercrime in accordance with the  requirements.
Especially in the case of the first countries that ratified the Convention, there are serious  concerns with regard to its full implementation.
Even in large countries such as Germany and the United  States, it is unlikely that the Convention has been fully implemented.
Germany, for example, contrary to  the intent of Article 2 of the Convention on Cybercrime, does not criminalize illegal access to computer  systems, but only illegal access to computer data.1109 The country profile of the US cybercrime legislation  posted  on  the  Council  of  Europe  website  indicates  that  18  USC.
§ 1030(a)(1)  –  (5)  corresponds  to  Article 2.1110 Unlike  Article 2  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime,  however,  18  USC  § 1030(a)  does  not  criminalize  mere  access  to  a  computer  system.
In  addition  to  “access”  to  a  computer  system,  the  provision requires further acts (like for example “obtaining” information).1111    Global debate  One  frequently  criticized  aspect  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  is  the  inadequate  representation  of  developing  countries  in  the  drafting  process.1112 Despite  the  transnational  dimension  of  cybercrime,  its  impact  in  the  different  regions  of  the  world  is  different.
This  is  especially  relevant  for  developing  countries.1113 Not only was the Convention on Cybercrime negotiated without any broad involvement of  developing  countries  in  Asia,  Africa  and  Latin  America,  but  it  also  places  restrictive  conditions  on  the  participation of non-members of the Council of Europe, even though it was designed to be open to non- members.
Based  on  Article 37  thereof,  accession  to  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  requires  consulting  with and obtaining the unanimous consent of the contracting states to the Convention on Cybercrime.
In  addition, participation in the deliberations on possible future amendments is restricted to parties to the  Convention.1114 The  debate  within  the  framework  of  preparation  of  the  twelfth  UN  Crime  Congress  showed  that  developing  countries  in  particular  are  interested  in  an  international  approach  rather  than  joining  regional  initiatives.
During  the  regional  preparatory  meetings  for  the  twelfth  United  Nations  Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice for Latin America and Caribbean1115, Western Asia1116,  Asia and Pacific1117 and Africa,1118 countries called for the development of an international convention on  cybercrime.
Similar calls were raised within academia.1119       125   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Lack of response to recent trends  Cybercrime  is  an  area  of  crime  that  is  constantly  changing.1120 In  the  1990s,  when  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime was developed, terrorist use of the Internet1121, botnet attacks1122 and phishing1123 either were  not known or did not play as important a role as they do today,1124 and could therefore not be addressed  with specific solutions.
Article 20  (1)(f) of the Convention on the Protection of Children criminalizes “knowingly obtaining access, through  information and communication technologies, to child pornography”.
Based  on the  motivation  provided  in  the  Explanatory  Report,  the  drafters  decided to include this provision to cover cases where offenders view child images online by accessing  child-pornography  sites  but  without  downloading  material.
This  means,  as  a  consequence,  that  the  Convention on Cybercrime does not cover such acts and therefore in this regard does not even meet the  Council of Europe’s own current standards.
Interception  of  voice-over-IP  (VoIP)  communication,  the  admissibility  of  digital  evidence  and  procedures  to  deal  with  the  emerging  use  of  encryption technology and means of anonymous communication are issues that are of great relevance to,  but not addressed by, the Convention on Cybercrime.
With  changing  technologies  and  criminal  behaviour,  criminal  law  needs  to  be  adjusted.
As  pointed  out  before, requirements in terms of cybercrime legislation have changed in the last ten years.
Other regional organizations, such as  the  European  Union,  have  just  reviewed  their  legal  instruments  addressing  cybercrime,  which  were  introduced more recently, around five years ago.
The  European  Union,  a  strong  supporter  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime,  declared recently that in its view “updating of the Convention [on Cybercrime] [...] cannot be considered a  feasible option”.1125   is  true  with  regard  to  procedural   Focus on accession of countries that provide infrastructure instead of developing countries   Within the last ten years that Council of Europe did not succeed to get accessions by small and developing  countries.
One  of  the  reasons  is  the  fact  that  the  Convention  was  negotiated  with  an  inadequate  representation  of  developing  countries.1126 Especially  Asia  and  Africa  were  underrepresented  and  Latin  America  was  not  represented  at  all.
Although  the  Council  of  Europe  invites  representatives  from  developing countries to it’s main Cybercrime conference those countries are not allowed to participate in  in  the  deliberations  on  possible  future  amendments  as  those  meetings  are  restricted  to  parties  to  the  Convention.1127   Differences  compared  to  truly  international  instruments  such  as  UN  conventions  can  also  be  observed  when it comes to the accession process.
Unlike  a  UN  Convention,  the  accession to the Convention on Cybercrime requires consultation with and the unanimous consent of the  contracting states to the Convention.1128 Consequently especially the developing countries have started to  call for a (more) international approach during the preparation of the 12th UN Crime Congress.
Within the  regional preparatory meetings for the Congress for Latin America and Caribbean1129, Western Asia1130, Asia  and Pacific1131 and Africa,1132 the participating countries called for the development of such international  instrument.
Although the strategy of the Council of Europe to focus on western countries seem logical as they host the  infrastructure, the involvement of developing countries is crucial if focus should include potential victims.
In  2005,  the  number  of  Internet  users  in  developing  countries  surpassed  the  number  in  industrial  nations.
1133 By  excluding  developing  countries  and  focussing  instead  on  developed  countries  that   126   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     (currently)  provide  most  of  the  infrastructure  and  services,  two  crucial  aspects  are  ignored:  the  importance  of  protecting  the  (majority)  of  users  of  Internet  services,  and,  secondly,  the  strongly  increasing  influence  of  emerging  countries  like  India,  China  and  Brazil.
Without  supporting  developing  countries  in  establishing  legislation  that  enables  them  to  investigate  cases  in  which  their  nationals  are  affected  and  in  addition  also  to  cooperate  internationally  with  other  law  enforcement  units  regarding  identification of offenders, Cybercrime investigations will be more difficult if they involve those countries.
The fact that in the last 10 years no developing country has acceded to the Convention or has ratified it,  shows  the  limitations  of  a  regional  approach.
This  is  certainly related to the fact that the needs of developing countries with regard to legislation as well as  capacity building and technical assistance in general go beyond the mechanisms of the Convention.
Further  more  the  countries  might  already  require  help  with  drafting of national legislation because the provisions contained in the Convention require an adjustment  process during the implementation.
This  issue  was  discussed  in  detail  during  the  12th  UN  Crime  Congress  and  led  the  UN  Member  States  deciding  upon  strengthening  the  capacity  building  mandate  of  the  United  Nations  Office  on  Drugs  and  Crimes  (UNODC)  International  Telecommunications Union (ITU) have recently received similar mandates.1135    (magistrate/prosecutor/police  office)  and  on  what  basis   investigation   certain   in  the  area  of  Cybercrime.
1134  Other  UN  organizations   like  the   Not designed for small and developing countries  Small and developing countries face difficulties in implementing the standards of the Convention.
One of the provisions that causes difficulties when it comes to the implementation in small countries is  the need to establish a 24/7 point of contact.
Such contact point can have a highly positive impact on the  speed of investigations and Article 35 is consequently one of the most important instruments provided by  the Convention.1137 However, it should be mentioned that recently the Council of Europe has published a  study analysing the effectiveness of international cooperation against cybercrime1138 and a study on the  functioning of 24/7 points of contact against cybercrime1139 and the result of these two studies is that not  all  countries  which  have  ratified  the  Convention  have  established  such  a  contact  point  even  countries  which have provided such a contact point often only use it for limited purposes.
The  main  problem  for  developing  countries  is  the  fact  that  the  establishment  of  such  contact  point  is  mandatory.
While  for  developed  countries  establishing  and  maintaining  such  a  contact  point  will  most  likely not be challenging utilising a specialized police force dealing with cybercrime in night and day shifts,  is however a challenge for countries where the specialized police force dealing with cybercrime consists of  only  one  single  police  man.
In  those  cases  the  obligation  will  require  significant  investments.
That  the  accession to and implementation of the Convention does not have associated costs for the countries, as  was recently stated by a Council of Europe representative at a conference in the Pacific1140 is therefore  only accurate if indirect costs, e.g.
for maintaining a 24/7 contact point or for implementing technology to  record traffic data in real time, are excluded.
Examples      127   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     are  provisions  dealing  with  the  admissibility  of  electronic  evidence1144 or  with  the  liability  of  Internet  Service  Providers  (ISPs).
1145 And  unless  a  country  has  other  instruments  in  place or its courts hold such evidence admissible, the country might not be able to sentence any offenders  despite having fully implemented the Convention.
European Union1150   5.2.2  Over  the  past  decade,  the  European  Union  (EU)  has  developed  several  legal  instruments  addressing  aspects  of  cybercrime.
While  those  instruments  are  in  general  only  binding  for the  27 Member  States,  several  countries  and  regions  are  using  the  EU  standards  as  a  reference  point  in  their  national  and  regional discussions on harmonization of legislation.1151   Situation until December 2009  Until 2009, the EU’s mandate in regard to criminal law was limited and contested.1152 In addition to the  challenge posed by the fact that the mandate was limited, it was uncertain whether the mandate for any  criminal legislation, including cybercrime, lay with the so-called “First Pillar” (European Community) or the  “Third Pillar” (European Union).1153 Since the prevailing opinion was that the third pillar was responsible,  harmonization was therefore only possible on the basis of intergovernmental cooperation within the third  pillar of the European Union dealing with police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.1154 When, in  2005,  the  Court  of  Justice  declared  a  third-pillar  instrument  in  the  area  of  criminal  law  (the  Council  Framework Decision on the Protection of the Environment through Criminal Law1155) to be unlawful1156,  the  distribution  of  power  was  challenged  for  the  first  time.
In  2007,  the  Court  of  Justice  confirmed  the  legal  practice  in  a  second  court  decision.1158   Situation after the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon  The  Treaty  of  Lisbon  (the  “Reform  Treaty”),1159 which  came  into  force  in  December 2009,  changed  the  function of the European Union significantly.
Based on Article 4, paragraph 2.j, the development of computer-crime legislation falls  under  shared  competence  between  the  EU  and  Member  States.
In the “Stockholm Programme”, adopted by the European Council in 2009, the EU underlined that it will  make use of the new mandate.1161 The programme is a definition of the focus of EU work in the area of  justice and home affairs for a period of five years, and follows the Hague Programme which expired in  2009.1162 It underlines the EU’s intention to make use of the mandate by referring to the areas of crime  mentioned  in  TFEU  Article 83,  paragraph 1,  and  giving  priority  to  the  areas  of  child  pornography  and  computer crime.1163    Overview of EU instruments and guidelines  Despite the fundamental changes in the structure of the EU, instruments that have been adopted in the  past  remain  in  force.
Based  on  Article 9  of  the  Protocol  on  Transitional  Provisions,  the  instruments  adopted on the basis of the Treaty on European Union prior to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon  shall be preserved until those acts are repealed, annulled or amended in implementation of the treaties.
launched  the   General policies   Back  in  1996  already,  the  EU  addressed  risks  related  to  the  Internet  in  a  communication  dealing  with  illegal  and  harmful  content  on  the  Internet.1164 The  EU  highlighted  the  importance  of  cooperation  between Member States to combat illegal content online.1165 In 1999, the European Parliament and the  Council adopted an action plan on promoting safer use of the Internet and combating illegal and harmful  content on global networks.1166 The action plan focused on self-regulation rather than criminalization.
Also  in  1999,  the  EU  initiative  “eEurope”,  by  adopting  the  European  Commission’s  Communication “eEurope – An Information Society for all”.1167 The initiative defines key goals, but does  not  deal  with  criminalization  of  illegal  acts  committed  by  using  information  technology.
In  2001,  the  European  Commission  (EC)  published  a  Communication  titled  “Creating  a  Safer  Information  Society  by  Improving the Security of Information Infrastructures and Combating Computer-related Crime”.1168 In this  communication, the EC analysed and addressed the problem of cybercrime and pointed out the need for  effective action to deal with threats to the integrity, availability and dependability of information systems  and networks.
Information  and  communication  infrastructures  have  become  a  critical  part  of  our  economies.
Although, for a number of reasons, there are no reliable statistics, there is little doubt that these offences  constitute  a  threat  to  industry  investment  and  assets,  and  to  safety  and  confidence  in  the  information  society.
There  is  scope  for  action  both  in  terms  of  preventing  criminal  activity  by  enhancing  the  security  of  information  infrastructures  and  by  ensuring  that the  law  enforcement  authorities  have  the  appropriate  means to act, whilst fully respecting the fundamental rights of individuals.1169  The Commission having participated in both the C.oE.
But effective co-operation within the EU to combat  Cybercrime  is  an  essential  element  of  a  safer  Information  Society  and  the  establishment  of  an  Area  of  Freedom, Security and Justice1170.
This  will  include  offences related to hacking and denial of service attacks.
The Commission will also examine the scope for  action  against  racism  and  xenophobia  on  the  Internet  with  a  view  to  bringing  forward  a  Framework  Decision under Title VI of the TEU covering both off-line and on-line racist and xenophobic activity.
Finally,  the problem of illicit drugs on the Internet will also be examined.1171  The Commission will continue to play a full role in ensuring co-ordination between Member States in other  international  for  a  in  which  Cybercrime  is  being  discussed  such  as  the  Council  of  Europe  and  G8.
The  Commission’s  initiatives  at  EU  level  will  take  full  account  of  progress  in  other  international  fora,  while  seeking to achieve approximation within the EU.1172   In  addition  to  the  communication  on  computer-related  crime  the  EC  published  a  communication  on  “Network  and  Information  Security”1173 in  2001  that  analysed  the  problems  in  network  security  and  drafted a strategic outline for action in this area.
Both these EC communications emphasized the need for approximation of substantive criminal law within  the  European  Union  –  especially  with  regard  to  attacks  against  information  systems.
Harmonization  of  substantive criminal law within the European Union in the fight against cybercrime is recognized as a key  element of all initiatives at the EU level.1174   In 2007, the EC published a communication towards a general policy on the fight against cybercrime.1175  The communication summarizes the current situation and emphasizes the importance of the Council of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  as  the  predominant  international  instrument  in  the  fight  against  cybercrime.
These include:   strengthening international cooperation in the fight against cybercrime;   •  •  better coordinated financial support for training activities;  •  the organization of a meeting of law-enforcement experts;  •  strengthening the dialogue with industry;  •  monitoring the evolving threats of cybercrime to evaluate the need for further legislation.
E-Commerce Directive (2000)  The  EU  Directive  on  Electronic  Commerce1176 addresses,  among  other  issues,  the  liability  of  Internet  service  provider  (ISP)  for  acts  committed  by  third  parties  (Article 12  et  seq.).
Taking  into  account  the  challenges stemming from the international dimension of the network, the drafters decided to develop  legal  standards  to  provide  a  framework  for  the  overall  development  of  the  information  society  and  to  support overall economic development as well as the work of law-enforcement agencies.1177 It is based on  the  consideration  that  development  of  information-society  services  is  hampered  by  a  number  of  legal  obstacles  to  the  proper  functioning  of  the  internal  market,  which  gives  the  European  Community  its  mandate.1178 The regulation of liability is based on the principle of graduated responsibility.1179 Although  the Directive highlights that there is no intention to harmonize the field of criminal law as such, it does  also regulate liability under criminal law.1180    Council Decision to combat child pornography on the Internet (1999)  In 2000, the Council of the European Union undertook an approach to address child pornography on the  Internet.
The Decision that was adopted is a follow-up to the 1996 communication on illegal and harmful  content on the Internet1181 and the related 1999 action plan on promoting safer use of the Internet and  combating  illegal  and  harmful  content  on  global  networks.1182 However,  the  Decision  does  not  contain  obligations with regard to the adoption of specific criminal law provisions.
The  EU  Framework Decision on combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment1183 contains  obligations to harmonize criminal law legislation with regard to specific aspects of computer-related fraud  and  the  production  of  instruments,  such  as  computer  programs,  that  are  specifically  adopted  for  the  purpose of committing an offence mentioned in the Framework Decision.1184      Article 3 – Offences related to computers  Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the following conduct is a criminal  offence when committed intentionally: performing or causing a transfer of money or monetary value and  thereby causing an unauthorised loss of property for another person, with the intention of procuring an  unauthorised economic benefit for the person committing the offence or for a third party, by:  — without right introducing, altering, deleting or suppressing computer data, in particular identification  data, or  — without right interfering with the functioning of a computer programme or system.
In line with the prevailing opinion at that time and as a consequence of the lack of a mandate in the first  pillar,  the  instrument  was  developed  under  the  third  pillar,  thereby  highlighting  that  in  view  of  the  international dimension of the phenomena involved, such issues cannot be adequately addressed by the  Member States themselves.
European Union Council Framework Decision on attacks against information systems (2005)  After the publication of the general policy in 2001, the EC presented a proposal for a framework decision  on  attacks  against  information  systems.1185 It  was  modified  and  adopted  by  the  Council  in  2005.1186  Although  it  takes  note  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime,1187 it  concentrates  on  the  harmonization of substantive criminal law provisions that are designed to protect infrastructure elements.
Aspects  of  criminal  procedural  law  (especially  the  harmonization  of  the  instruments  necessary  to  investigate and prosecute cybercrime) and instruments related to the international cooperation were not  integrated into the framework decision.
It highlights the gaps and differences in the legal frameworks of  the Member States and effective police and judicial cooperation in the area of attacks against information  systems.1188     Article 2 – Illegal access to information systems   1.
Each  Member  State  shall  take  the  necessary  measures to  ensure that  the  intentional  access without  right to the whole or any part of an information system is punishable as a criminal offence, at least for  cases which are not minor.
Each Member State may decide that the conduct referred to in paragraph 1 is incriminated only where  the  offence  is  committed  by  infringing  a  security  measure.
Article 3 – Illegal system interference   Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the intentional serious hindering or  interruption of the functioning of an information system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting,  deteriorating,  altering,  suppressing  or  rendering  inaccessible  computer  data  is  punishable  as  a  criminal  offence when committed without right, at least for cases which are not minor.
Article 4 – Illegal data interference   Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the intentional deletion, damaging,  deterioration,  alteration,  suppression  or  rendering  inaccessible  of  computer  data  on  an  information  system is punishable as a criminal offence when committed without right, at least for cases which are not  minor.
By  way  of  derogation  from  Articles  5,  6  and  9  of  Directive  2002/58/EC,  Member  States  shall  adopt  measures to ensure that the data specified in Article 5 of this Directive are retained in accordance with the  provisions  thereof,  to  the  extent  that  those  data  are  generated  or  processed  by  providers  of  publicly  available  electronic  communications  services  or  of  a  public  communications  network  within  their  jurisdiction in the process of supplying the communications services concerned.
The  obligation  to  retain  data  provided  for  in  paragraph  1  shall  include  the  retention  of  the  data  specified in Article 5 relating to unsuccessful call attempts where those data are generated or processed,  and  stored  (as  regards  telephony  data)  or  logged  (as  regards  Internet  data),  by  providers  of  publicly  available electronic communications services or of a public communications network within the jurisdiction  of the Member State concerned in the pro- cess of supplying the communication services concerned.
This  Directive shall not require data relating to unconnected calls to be retained.
The fact that key information about any communication on the Internet will be covered by the Directive  led to intensive criticism from human rights organizations and could lead to a review of the Directive and  its implementation by constitutional courts.1190 In the conclusion of the case Productores de Música de  España (Promusicae) v. Telefónica de España,1191 the adviser to the European Court of Justice, Advocate  General Juliane Kokott, pointed out that it is questionable whether the data retention obligation can be  implemented  without  a  violation  of  fundamental  rights.
1192  Potential  difficulties  concerning  the  implementation of such regulations were already highlighted by the G8 in 2001.1193  The Directive was based on the European Community’s mandate for the internal market (Article 95).1194  The drafters highlighted that differing legal and technical standards related to the retention of data for  the  purpose  of  investigating  cybercrime  present  obstacles  to  the  internal  market  for  electronic  communications,  insofar  as  service  providers  face  different  requirements  entailing  different  financial  investments.1195 Ireland, supported by Slovakia, asked the European Court of Justice to annul the Directive  because it had not been adopted on an appropriate legal basis.
Both countries argued that Article 95 was  not a sufficient basis, since the focus of the instrument was not on the functioning of the internal market  but rather the investigation, detection and prosecution of crime.
The European Court of Justice dismissed  the  action  as  unfounded,  pointing  out  that  differences  with  regard  to  obligations  to  retain  data  would  have a direct impact on the functioning of the internal market.1196 It furthermore highlighted that such a  situation  justified  the  Community  legislature  in  pursuing  the  objective  of  safeguarding  the  proper  functioning of the internal market through the adoption of harmonized rules.
Amendment of the European Union Council Framework Decision on combating terrorism (2007)  In  2007,  the  European  Union  started  discussion  on  a  draft  amendment  of  the  Framework  Decision  on  combating terrorism.1197 In the introduction to the draft amendment, the EU highlights that the existing  legal framework criminalizes aiding or abetting and inciting but does not criminalize the dissemination of  terrorist expertise through the Internet.1198 With the amendment, the EU is aiming to take measures to  close the gap and bring the legislation throughout the EU closer to the Council of Europe Convention on  the Prevention of Terrorism.
Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that terrorist-linked offences include  the following intentional acts:               (a) public provocation to commit a terrorist offence;  (b) recruitment for terrorism;  (c) training for terrorism;  (d) aggravated theft with a view to committing one of the acts listed in Article 1(1);  (e) extortion with a view to the perpetration of one of the acts listed in Article 1(1);  (f) drawing up false administrative documents with a view to committing one of the acts listed in  Article 1(1)(a) to (h) and Article 2(2)(b).
For an act to be punishable as set forth in paragraph 2, it shall not be necessary that a terrorist offence  be actually committed.”    Based  on  Article 3(1)(c)1199 of  the  Framework  Decision,  the  Member States  are,  for example,  obliged  to  criminalize  the  publication  of  instructions  on  how  to  use  explosives,  knowing  that  this  information  is  intended to be used for terrorist-related purposes.
The need for evidence that the information is intended  to be used for terrorist-related purposes very likely limits the application of the provision with regard to  the majority of instructions on how to use weapons that are available online, as their publication does not  directly  link  them  to  terrorist  attacks.
As  most  of  the  weapons  and  explosives  can  be  used  to  commit  “regular” crimes as well as terrorist-related offences (dual use), the information itself can hardly be used  to  prove  that  the  person who  published  them  had  knowledge  about  the  way  such  information  is  used  afterwards.
on  a  website  operated  by  a  terrorist  organization) needs to be taken into consideration.
Directive on child pornography   The first cybercrime-related draft legal framework presented after the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon  was the proposal for a Directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and  child pornography1200 that was adopted in 2011.1201 The drafters pointed out that information technology  enables  offenders  to  produce  and  distribute  child  pornography  more  easily1202 and  emphasizes  the  importance  of  addressing  the  resulting  challenges  with  specific  provisions.
It  implements  international  standards,  such  as  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  the  Protection  of  Children  against  Sexual  Exploitation and Sexual Abuse.1203     Article 5 – Offences concerning child pornography   1.
Member  States  shall  take  the  necessary  measures  to  ensure  that  the  intentional  conduct,  when  committed without right, referred to in paragraphs 2 to 6 is punishable.
Knowingly  obtaining  access,  by  means  of  information  and  communication  technology,  to  child  pornography shall be punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 1 year.
Like the Convention, the Directive proposes the criminalization of obtaining access to child pornography  by  means  of  information  and  communication  technology.1204 This  enables  law-enforcement  agencies  to  prosecute offenders in cases where they are able to prove that the offender opened websites with child  pornography,  but  are  unable  to  prove  that  the  offender  downloaded  material.
Such  difficulties  in  collecting  evidence  arise,  for  example,  if  the  offender  is  using  encryption  technology  to  protect  downloaded files on his storage media.1205 The Explanatory Report to the Convention on the Protection of  Children points out that the provision should also be applicable in cases where the offender only views  child  pornography  pictures  online  without  downloading  them.1206 In  general,  opening  a  website  does  automatically  initiate  a  download  process  –  often  without  the  knowledge  of  the  user.
This can, for example, be the case if the website enables streaming  videos  and,  due  to  the  technical  configuration  of  the  streaming  process,  does  not  buffer  the  received  information but discards it straight after transmission.1208     Article 25 – Measures against websites containing or disseminating child pornography   1.
Member  States  shall  take  the  necessary  measures  to  ensure  the  prompt  removal  of  web  pages  containing  or  disseminating  child  pornography  hosted  in  their  territory  and  to endeavour to obtain  the  removal of such pages hosted outside of their territory.
Member  States  may  take  measures  to  block  access  to  web  pages  containing  or  disseminating  child  pornography towards the Internet users within their territory.
These measures must be set by transparent  procedures and provide adequate safeguards, in particular to ensure that the restriction is limited to what  is  necessary  and  proportionate,  and  that  users  are  informed  of  the  reason  for  the  restriction.
Those  safeguards shall also include the possibility of judicial redress.
In  addition  to  the  criminalization  of  acts  related  to  child  pornography,  the  initiation  draft  contained  a  provision  that  obliges  Member  States  to  implement  the  process  of  blocking  websites  containing  child  pornography.1209 Several  European  countries,1210 as  well  as  non-European  countries  like  China,1211 Iran1212  and Thailand,1213 use such an approach.
Concerns relate to the fact that none of the technical concepts  has  proven  to  be  effective,1214 and  the  approach  entails  a  concomitant  risk  of  over-blocking.1215 As  a  consequence the mandatory blocking was changed and it was left to Member States to decide if blocking  obligations should be implemented on the national level.
Draft Directive on attacks against information systems (not adopted by end of 2011)  In  September  2010,  the  European  Union  presented  a  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  attacks  against  information systems.1216 As described in more detail above, the EU adopted a Council Framework Decision  on  attacks  against  information  systems  in  2005.1217 The  Explanatory  Memorandum  to  the  proposal  highlights that the intention of the drafters was to update and strengthen the legal framework to fight  cybercrime in the European Union by responding to new methods of committing crimes.1218 In addition to  the  criminalization  of  illegal  access  (Article 3),  illegal  system  interference  (Article 4)  and  illegal  data  interference  (Article 5)  already  introduced  by  the  2005  Framework  Decision,  the  2010  draft  Directive  contains two additional offences.
134   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Draft Article 6 – Illegal interception  Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the intentional interception by technical  means, of non-public transmissions of computer data to, from or within a information system, including  electromagnetic emissions from an information system carrying such computer data, is punishable as a  criminal offence when committed without right.
Draft Article 7 – Tools used for committing offences  Member States shall take the necessary measure to ensure that the production, sale, procurement for use,  import, possession, distribution or otherwise making available of the following is punishable as a criminal  offence when committed intentionally and without right for the purpose of committing any of the offences  referred to in Articles 3 to 6:  (a) device, including a computer program, designed or adapted primarily for the purpose of committing  any of the offences referred to in Articles 3 to 6;  (b) a computer password, access code, or similar data by which the whole or any part of an information  system is capable of being accessed.
In 1999, the European Union expressed its perspective on the Convention on Cybercrime in a  common position.1219 It called for Member States to support the drawing up of the Council of Europe’s  draft Convention on Cybercrime.1220 At that time, the EU itself had no mandate to develop a similar legal  framework.
First,  EU  directives have to be implemented within a short, specified time-frame, whereas the Council of Europe  has no means of enforcing the signature and ratification of conventions apart from political pressure.1222  Secondly,  the  EU  has  a  practice  of  constantly  updating  its  instruments,  whereas  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention on Cybercrime has not been updated in the last ten years.
5.2.3  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development1223  In 1983, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) initiated a study on the  possibility  of  international harmonization  of  criminal  law  in  order  to  address  the  problem  of  computer  crime.1224 In 1985, it published a report that analysed the current legislation and made proposals for the  fight against cybercrime.1225 It recommended a minimum list of offences that countries should consider  criminalizing, e.g.
In  1990,  the  Information,  Computer  and  Communications  Policy  (ICCP)  Committee  created  an  Expert  Group  to  develop  a  set  of  guidelines  for  information  security,  which  was  drafted  by  1992  and  then  adopted  by  the  OECD  Council.1226 The  guidelines include, among other aspects, the issues of sanctions:         135   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Sanctions for misuse of information systems are an important means in the protection of the interests of  those relying on information systems from harm resulting from attacks to the availability, confidentiality  and integrity of information systems and their components.
Examples of such attacks include damaging or  disrupting information systems by inserting viruses and worms, alteration of data, illegal access to data,  computer  fraud  or  forgery,  and  unauthorised  reproduction  of  computer  programs.
There is  growing  international  agreement  on  the  core  of  computer-related  offences  that  should  be  covered  by  national penal laws.
This is reflected in the development of computer crime and data protection legislation  in  OECD  Member  countries  during  the  last  two  decades  and  in  the  work  of  the  OECD  and  other  international bodies on legislation to combat computer-related crime [...].
National legislation should be  reviewed  periodically  to  ensure  that  it  adequately  meets  the  dangers  arising  from  the  misuse  of  information systems.
After reviewing the guidelines in 1997, the ICCP created a second Expert Group in 2001 that updated the  guidelines.
In  2002,  a  new  version  of  the  guidelines  “OECD  Guidelines  for  the  Security  of  Information  Systems and Networks: Towards a Culture of Security” was adopted as a Recommendation of the OECD  Council.1227 The guidelines contain nine complementary principles:     1) Awareness   Participants should be aware of the need for security of information systems and networks and what they  can do to enhance security.
2) Responsibility   All participants are responsible for the security of information systems and networks.
3) Response   Participants should act in a timely and co-operative  manner to prevent, detect and respond to security  incidents.
5) Democracy   The  security  of  information  systems  and  networks  should  be  compatible  with  essential  values  of  a  democratic society.
7) Security design and implementation   Participants should incorporate security as an essential element of information systems and networks.
8) Security management   Participants should adopt a comprehensive approach to security management.
9) Reassessment   Participants  should  review  and  reassess  the  security  of  information  systems  and  networks,  and  make  appropriate modifications to security policies, practices, measures and procedures.
In  2005,  OECD  published  a  report  that  analysed  the  impact  of  spam  on  developing  countries.1228 The  report  showed  that,  on  account  of  their  more  limited  and  more  expensive  resources,  spam  is  a  much  more  serious  issue  in  developing  countries  than  in  developed  countries  such  as  the  OECD  Member  States.1229 After  receiving  a  request  from  the  Strategic  Planning  Unit  of  the  Executive  Office  of  the  Secretary  General  of  the  United  Nations  to  produce  a  comparative  outline  of  domestic  legislative  solutions regarding the use of the Internet for terrorist purposes, in 2007 OECD published a report on the  legislative treatment of “cyberterror” in the domestic law of individual states.1230 In 2008, OECD published  a  Scoping  Paper  on  online  identity  theft.1231 The  paper  provides  an  overview  of  the  characteristics  of  identity  theft,  the  different  forms  of  identity  theft,  victim-related  issues  as  well  as  law-enforcement  schemes.
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation1234   5.2.4  The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) has identified cybercrime as an important field of activity,  and  APEC  leaders  have  called  for  closer  cooperation  among  officials  involved  in  the  fight  against  cybercrime.1235 The  Declaration  of  the  2008  meeting  of  the  APEC  Telecommunication  and  Information  Ministers  in  Bangkok,  Thailand,  highlighted  the  importance  of  continuing  collaboration  to  combat  cybercrime.1236 Until now, APEC has not provided a legal framework on cybercrime, but has referred to  international  standards  such  as  the  Budapest  Convention  on  Cybercrime.
In  addition,  APEC  has  closely  studied the national cybercrime legislation in various countries1237 under a cybercrime legislation survey,  and  has  developed  a  database  of  approaches  to  assist  economies  in  developing  and  reviewing  legislation.1238 The questionnaire used for the survey was based on the legal framework provided by the  Budapest Convention on Cybercrime.
Statement on fighting terrorism (2002)   In  2002,  APEC  leaders  released  a  Statement  on  Fighting  Terrorism  and  Promoting  Growth  to  enact  comprehensive laws relating to cybercrime and develop national cybercrime investigating capabilities.1239  They  committed  to  endeavouring  to  enact  a  comprehensive  set  of  laws  relating  to  cybersecurity  and  cybercrime  that  are  consistent  with  the  provisions  of  international  legal  instruments,  including  United  Nations  General  Assembly  Resolution  55/63  and  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime,  by  October 2003.
In addition, they committed to identifying national cybercrime units and international high- technology assistance points of contact and creating such capabilities, to the extent they do not already  exist,  by  October  2003,  and  establishing  institutions  that  exchange  threat  and  vulnerability  assessment  (such as computer emergency response teams), by October 2003.
Conference on cybercrime legislation (2005)  APEC has organized various conferences1240 and called for closer cooperation among officials involved in  the fight against cybercrime.1241 In 2005, APEC organized a Conference on Cybercrime Legislation.
1242 The  primary  objectives  of  the  conference  were  to  promote  the  development  of  comprehensive  legal  frameworks  to  combat  cybercrime  and  promote  cybersecurity;  assist  law-enforcement  authorities  to  respond to cutting-edge issues and the challenges raised by advances in technology; promote cooperation  between cybercrime investigators across the region.
Telecommunications and Information Working Group  The  APEC  Telecommunications  and  Information  Working  Group 1243 actively  participated  in  APEC’s  approaches  to  increase  cybersecurity.1244 In  2002,  it  adopted  the  APEC  Cybersecurity  Strategy.1245 The  Working  Group  expressed  their  position  regarding  cybercrime  legislation  by  referring  to  existing  international approaches from the UN and the Council of Europe.1246 Experiences with drafting cybercrime  legislation were discussed within the context of the e-Security Task Group of the Telecommunications and  Information Working Group during two conferences1247 in Thailand in 2003.1248    The Commonwealth   5.2.5  Cybercrime is among the issues addressed by the Commonwealth.
This  approach  to  harmonize  legislation  within  the  Commonwealth  and  enable international cooperation was influenced, among other things, by the fact that, without such an  approach, it would require no fewer than 1 272 bilateral treaties within the Commonwealth to deal with  international cooperation in this matter.1249  Taking  into  account  the  rising  importance  of  cybercrime,  the  Law  Ministers  of  the  Commonwealth  decided to order an expert group to develop a legal framework for combating cybercrime on the basis of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime.1250 The  Expert  Group  presented  its  report  and      137   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     recommendations  in  March 2002.1251 Later  in  2002,  the  draft  Model  Law  on  Computer  and  Computer  Related Crime was presented.1252 Due to the clear instruction as well as the recognition of the Council of  Europe Convention on Cybercrime as an international standard by the expert group, the model law largely  corresponds  to  the  standards  defined  by  that  Convention.
At  the  2000  meeting,  the  Law  Ministers  and  Attorney-Generals  of  small  Commonwealth  jurisdictions  decided to set up an expert group to develop model legislation on digital evidence.
The model law was  presented in 2002.1253  In  addition  to  providing  legislation,  the  Commonwealth  has  organized  several  training  activities.
The  Commonwealth  Network  of  IT  and  Development  (COMNET-IT)  co-organized  training  on  cybercrime  in  April 2007.
Another training  was organized in 2011.
African Union    5.2.6  During  the  extra-ordinary  conference  of  the  African  Union  Ministers  in  charge  of  Communcation  and  Information Technologies, which was held in Johannesburg in 2009, the minsters addressed various topics  related to the increasing use of ICT in the African country.
It was decided that African Union Commission  should  –  jointly  with  the  UN  Economic  Commission  for  Africa  –  develop  a  legal  framework  for  African  countries that addresses issues like electronic transactions, cyber security and data protection.1255   In  2011  the  African  Union  presented  the  Draft  African  Union  Convention  on  the  Establishment  of  a  Credible  Legal  Framework  for  Cyber  Security  in  Africa.1256 The  intention  of  the  drafters  is  to  strengthen  existing  legislation  in  Member  States  regarding  Information  and  Communication  Technologies.
With  regard to the mandate, that was not limited to cybercrime, but also included other information society  issues such as data protection and electronic transactions- The Convention is more comprehensive than  most  other  regional  approaches.
It  addresses  various  aspects  such  as  contractual  responsibility  of  an  electronic  provider  of  goods  and  services1257, treaty obligations in electronic form1258 and security of electronic transactions.1259 The second  part  deals  with  data  protection  issues.1260 The  third  part  is  related  to  combating  cybercrime.
This includes a set of six definitions (electronic communication, computerized data,  racism and xenophobia in ICTs, minor, child pornography and computer system).1261     Article III – 1:  For the purpose of this Convention:  1) Electronic communication means any transmission to the public or a section of the public by electronic  or  magnetic  means  of  communication,  signs,  signals,  written  matter,  pictures,  sounds  or  messages  of  whatsoever nature;   2) Computerized data means any representation of facts, information or concepts in any form that lends  itself to computer processing;   3) Racism and xenophobia in ICTs means any written matter, picture or any other representation of ideas  or theories which advocates or encourages hatred, discrimination or violence against a person or group of  persons for reasons of race, color, ancestry or national or ethnic origin or religion, where these serve as  pretext for either racism and xenophobia or as motivation thereof;   4) Minor means any person aged less than eighteen (18) years in terms of the United Nations Convention  on the Rights of the Child;    138   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     5) Child pornography means any data, regardless of the nature or form, which visually represents a minor  lending him/herself to explicit sexual act, or realistic images representing a minor lending himself/herself  to explicit sexual behavior;   6) Computer system means any device, be it isolated or otherwise, and a range of interconnected devices  used in part or in whole for automated processing of data for the purpose of executing a programme.
In addition the third part addresses the need of a national cybersecurity policy and a related strategy.1262  The second chapter deals with general aspects related to legal measures.
This includes standards related  to  statuatory  authorities,  democratic  principles,  protection  of  essential  information  infrastructure,  harmonization,  double  criminality  and  international  cooperation.1263 The  third  chapter  addresses  issues  related to a national cyber security system.
This includes a culture of security, the role of the government,  public-private partnership, education and training and public awareness-raising.1264 Chapter 4 is dedicated  to national cyber security monitoring structures.
The fifth chapter deals with international cooperation.
The  main  difference  to  comparable  regional  frameworks  such  as  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime is the fact that the Draft African Union Convention– if no other instrument for international  cooperation  is  in  place  –  cannot  be  used  for  such  purpose.
Article III – 1 – 21: International cooperation  Each Member State shall adopt such measures as it deems necessary to foster exchange of information  and  the  sharing  of  quick,  expeditious  and  reciprocal  data  by  Member  States’  organizations  and  similar  organizations of other Member States with responsibility to cause the law to be applied in the territory on  bilateral or multilateral basis.
Article III – 1 – 25: Model of international cooperation  Each  Member  State  shall  adopt  such  measures  and  strategies  as  it  deems  necessary  to  participate  in  regional  and  international  cooperation  in  cyber  security.
The  Resolutions  geared to  promoting Member  States’  participation  within  this  framework  of  relations  have  been  adopted  by  a  large  number  of  international governmental bodies including the United Nations, the African Union, the European Union,  the  G8,  etc.
Organizations  like  the  International  Telecommunication  Union,  the  Council  of  Europe,  the  Commonwealth of Nations and others, have established model frameworks for international cooperation  which Member States may adopt as a guide.
Section 1 includes a criminalization of illegal  access to a computer system1265, illegal remaining in a computer system1266, illegal system interference1267,  illegal data input1268, illegal data interception1269 and illegal data interference.1270 The provisions show a lot  of similarities with best practices from other regions – including standards introduced within Africa.
One  example is the criminalization of illegal remaining in a computer system that was introduced by the Draft  ECOWAS Directive.1271    Article III – 3:  Each Member State of the African Unions shall take the legislative measures required to set up as a penal  offense the fact of retaining oneself or attempting to retain oneself fraudulently in a part or the whole of a  computer system.
One new concept – however, not criminal law provision but a side measure – that was in this regard not  introduced by other regional frameworks is the introduction of an obligation of businesses to to submit  their products fro vulnerability testing.
139   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Article III-7:  [...]  2) The Member States shall adopt rules to compel ICT product vendors to submit their products for  vulnerability and guarantee tests to be conducted by independent experts and to divulge to the public any  form of vulnerability found in the said products and the measures recommended for a solution thereto.
Section  2  includes  the  criminalization  of  aspects  of  computer-related  forgery1272,  illegal  use  of  data1273,  illegal system interference with the intent to obtain an advantage1274, data protection violations1275, illegal  devices1276 and participation in a criminal organization.1277    Article III – 9:  Each Member State of the African Union shall take the legislative measures required to set up as a penal  offense the fact of using the data obtained with a full knowledge of a case.
Especially the criminalization of an illegal use of computer data is going beyond the standards defined by  most other regional instruments.
The  Draft  African  Convention  introduces  a  criminalization  of  producing  and  disseminating  child  pornography1278,  procuring  and  importing  child  pornography1279,  possessing  child  pornography1280,  facilitating  the  access  of  minors  to  pornography1281,  dissemination  of  racist  or  xenophobic  material 1282 ,  racist  attacks  perpetrated  through  computer  systems1283 ,  racist  abuse  through  computer  systems1284 and  denying  or  approving  genocide  or  crimes  against humanity.1285  The last section of Chapter 1 contains provisions that deal in a broader manner with legislation related to  Cybercrime and the admissibility of electronic evidence (“written electronic matter”).
Article III – 23 – 1: Laws against cyber crime  Each Member State shall adopt such legislative measures as it deems effective, to define material criminal  offenses as acts which affect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and survivability of ICT systems and  related  infrastructure  networks;  as  well  as  procedural  measures  deemed  effective  for  the  arrest  and  prosecution  of  offenders.
Member  States  shall  be  called  upon  to  take  on  board,  where  necessary,  the  approved  language  choice  in  international  cyber  crime  legislation  models  such  as  the  language  choice  adopted by the Council of Europe and the Commonwealth of Nations.
Article III – 23 – 2:  Each Member State of the African Union shall take the legislative measures required to ensure that written  electronic matter in respect of criminal matters are admissible to establish offenses under criminal law,  provided such written matter has been presented during debate and discussed before the judge, that the  person from which the written material emanates can be duly identified and the said material has been  prepared and conserved under conditions likely to guarantee their integrity.
Especially with regard to Article III-23-1 the intention of the drafters is not fully accessible as the crimes  contained in previous parts of Chapter 1 define crimes as crimes against the integrity and availability of  computer systems.
It is therefore uncertain how far Article III-23-1– with regard to the criminalization –  requires  countries  to  go  beyond  the  crimes  already  established  in  more  detail  by  the  Draft  African  Convention.
It  requires  countries  to  set  up  an  aggravation  of  penalty  if  traditional  crimes  are  committed  by  using  information  and  communication  technology1286,  the  criminalization  violation  of  property  by  offences  such  as  theft,  abuse  of  trust  or   140   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     blackmail  involving  computer  data1287,  update  provisions  that  include  dissemination  facilities  to  ensure  that the use of means of digital electronic communication is covered1288 and ensure that provisions that  protect secrecy in the interest of national security are applicable with regard to computer data.1289 Such  provisions are not included in other regional frameworks.
Article III – 24:  Each  Member  State  of  the  African  Union  shall  take  the  legislative  measures  required  to  set  up  as  an  aggravating circumstance the use of ICT to commit common law offenses such as theft, fraud, possession  of stolen goods, abuse of trust, extortion of money, terrorism, money laundering, etc.
It requires that Member States enable the conservation of computer  data 1290 ,  the  seizure  of  computer  data 1291 ,  expedited  preservation 1292  and  interception  of  data  communication.1293   Arab League and Gulf Cooperation Council1294   5.2.7  A  number  of  countries  in  the  Arabic  region  have  already  undertaken  national  measures  and  adopted  approaches  to  combat  cybercrime,  or  are  in  the  process  of  drafting  legislation.1295 Examples  of  such  countries  include  Pakistan,1296 Egypt1297 and  the  United  Arabic  Emirates  (UAE).1298 In  order  to  harmonize  legislation  in  the  region,  UAE  submitted  model  legislation  to  the  Arab  League  (Guiding  Law  to  Fight  IT  Crime).1299 In 2003, the Arab Interior Ministers Council and the Arab Justice Ministers Council adopted the  law.1300 The  Gulf  Cooperation  Council  (GCC)1301 recommended  at  a  conference  in  2007  that  the  GCC  countries seek a joint approach that takes into consideration international standards.1302    5.2.8  Organization of American States1303  Since  1999,  the  Organization  of  American  States  (OAS)  has  actively  been  addressing  the  issue  of  cybercrime within the region.
Among others, the organization has held a number of meetings within the  mandate  and  scope  of  REMJA,  the  Ministers  of  Justice  or  Ministers  or  Attorneys  General  of  the  Americas.1304    Intergovernmental expert group on cybercrime  In 1999, REMJA recommended the establishment of an intergovernmental expert group on cybercrime.
The expert group was mandated to complete a diagnosis of criminal activity which targets computers and  information, or which uses computers as the means of committing an offence; complete a diagnosis of  national  legislation,  policies  and  practices  regarding  such  activity;  identify  national  and  international  entities with relevant expertise; and finally identify mechanisms of cooperation within the inter-American  system to combat cybercrime.
Recommendations of the Ministers of Justice  REMJA has held eight meetings until 2010.1305 At the third meeting, in 2000, the Ministers of Justice or  Ministers  or  Attorneys  General  of  the  Americas  addressed  the  topic  of  cybercrime  and  agreed  on  a  number  of  recommendations.1306 These  recommendations  included  to  support  consideration  of  the  recommendations  made  by  the  Group  of  Governmental  Experts  at  its  initial  meeting  as  the  REMJA  contribution  to  the  development  of  the  Inter-American  Strategy  to  Combat  Threats  to  Cybersecurity,  referred  to  in  OAS  General  Assembly  Resolution  AG/RES.
1939  /XXXIII-O/03),  and  to  ask  the  group,  through  its  chair,  to  continue  to  support  the  preparation  of  the  strategy.
The  meeting  further  recommended  that  Member  States  should  review  mechanisms  to  facilitate  broad  and  efficient  cooperation  among  themselves  to  combat  cybercrime  and  study,  where  possible,  the  development  of      141   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     technical  and  legal  capacity  to  join  the  24/7  Network  established  by  the  G8  to  assist  in  cybercrime  investigations.
Member States were asked to evaluate the advisability of implementing the principles of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  and  consider  the  possibility  of  acceding  to  that  Convention.
Finally, the recommendations called for OAS Member States to  review and, if appropriate, update the structure and work of domestic bodies, or agencies in charge of  enforcing  the  laws  so  as  to  adapt  to  the  shifting  nature  of  cybercrime,  including  by  reviewing  the  relationship  between  agencies  that  combat  cybercrime  and  those  that  provide  traditional  police  or  mutual legal assistance.
The  fourth  meeting  of  Ministers  of  Justice  or  Ministers  or  Attorneys  General  of  the  Americas  in  2002  recommended  that,  in  the  framework  of  the  activities  of  the  OAS  working  group  to  follow  up  on  the  REMJA  recommendations,  the  Group  of  Governmental  Experts1307 on  cybercrime  be  reconvened  and  mandated to follow up on implementation of the recommendations prepared by that group and adopted  by  REMJA-III,  and  consider  the  preparation  of  pertinent  inter-American  legal  instruments  and  model  legislation  for  the  purpose  of  strengthening  hemispheric  cooperation  in  combating  cybercrime  and  considering  standards  relating  to  privacy,  the  protection  of  information,  procedural  aspects,  and  crime  prevention.
The  recommendations  of  the  sixth  meeting  of  Ministers  of  Justice1308 included  a  call  to  continue  to  strengthen cooperation with the Council of Europe so that the OAS Member States can give consideration  to applying the principles of the Convention on Cybercrime1309 and to adhering thereto, and to adopting  the legal and other measures required for its implementation.
Similarly, the meeting recommended that  efforts  should  continue  to  strengthen  mechanisms  for  exchange  of  information  and  cooperation  with  other international organizations and agencies in the area of cybercrime, such as the UN, the EU, APEC,  OECD, the G8, the Commonwealth and Interpol, in order for the OAS Member States to take advantage of  progress  in  those  forums.
Furthermore,  Member  States  were  asked  to  establish  specialized  units  to  investigate cybercrime, identify the authorities who will serve as the points of contact in this matter and  expedite the exchange of information and obtaining of evidence, and in addition, to foster cooperation in  efforts  to  combat  cybercrime  among  government  authorities  and  Internet  service  providers  and  other  private-sector enterprises providing data transmission services.
These  recommendations  were  reiterated  at  the  2008  meeting,1310 which  further  recommended  that,  bearing  in  mind  the  recommendations  adopted  by  the  Group  of  Governmental  Experts  and  by  the  previous  REMJA  meetings,  the  states  consider  applying  the  principles  of  the  Council  of  Europe’s  Convention on Cybercrime, acceding thereto, and adopting the legal and other measures required for its  implementation.
Similarly, the meeting recommended that technical cooperation activities continue to be  held under the auspices of the OAS General Secretariat, through the Secretariat for Legal Affairs, and the  Council of Europe, and that efforts be continued to strengthen exchange of information and cooperation  with other international organizations and agencies in the area of cybercrime, so that the OAS Member  States  may  take  advantage  of  progress  in  those  forums.
Finally,  the  secretariats  of  the  Inter-American  Committee against Terrorism (CICTE) and the Inter-American Telecommunication Commission (CITEL) and  the Working Group on Cybercrime were requested to continue developing permanent coordination and  cooperation  actions  to  ensure  the  implementation  of  the  Comprehensive  Inter-American  Cybersecurity  Strategy adopted through OAS General Assembly Resolution AG/RES.
In 2010, REMJA addressed the issue of cybercrime at their eighth meeting.1311 They briefly discussed the  importance  of  continuing  to  consolidate  and  update  the  Inter-American  Portal  for  Cooperation  in  Cybercrime through the OAS Internet page, and strengthening states’ capacity to develop legislation and  procedural  measures  related  to  cybercrime  and  electronic  evidence.
In  addition,  the  meeting’s  recommendations  highlighted  the  desire  to  strengthen  mechanisms  that  allow  for  the  exchange  of  information  and  cooperation  with  other  international  organizations  and  agencies  in  the  area  of  cybercrime, such as the Council of Europe, the UN, the EU, APEC, OECD, the G8, the Commonwealth and  Interpol, so that OAS Member States can take advantage of developments in those entities.
142   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response   in  at   Caribbean      5.2.9  In  December 2008,  ITU  and  the  EU  launched  the  project  “Enhancing  Competitiveness  in  the  Caribbean  through the Harmonization of ICT Policies, Legislation and Regulatory Procedures” (HIPCAR) to promote  the ICT sector in the Caribbean region.1312 The project forms part of the programme “ACP-Information and  Communication Technologies” and the ninth European Development Fund.
Under this project, nine work areas have been identified1315 in which model policies and model legislative  texts  were  developed  to  facilitate  the  development  and  harmonization  of  legislation  in  the  region.
Cybercrime was one of the nine work areas.
The development of the model legislative text took place in  three  phases.
In  parallel,  regional  and  international  best  practices  were  identified.
Priority  was  given  to  standards  that  are  directly  applicable  least  some  of  the  beneficiary  countries  (e.g.
However,  the  review  also  included  best  practices  from  other  regions,  such  as  the  EU  and  Africa.
The  assessment  report1316 contained  an  overview  of  the  existing  legislation, as well as a comparative law analysis that compared the existing legislation with regional and  international  best  practices.
In  order  to  prepare  a  gap  analysis,  the  assessment  report  in  addition  identified special needs in the region (such as legislation on spam) that are not necessarily addressed by  international  best  practices.
In the second phase, a model legislative text was developed taking into account the policy guidelines.
The model legislative text has three key aims: it provides specific sample language that is in line with  international best practices, it reflects the special demands of the region and it is developed with law- drafting practices in the region in mind, so as to ensure smooth implementation.
The model legislative  text contains a complex set of definitions, and substantive criminal law provisions, including provisions  dealing with issues like SPAM that have a high priority for the region but are not necessarily contained in  regional frameworks such as the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.
(1) A person who, intentionally without lawful excuse or justification:      a) intentionally initiates the transmission of multiple electronic mail messages from or through such  computer system; or  b) uses a protected computer system to relay or retransmit multiple electronic mail messages, with  the intent to deceive or mislead users, or any electronic mail or Internet service provider, as to the  origin of such messages, or  c)  materially  falsifies  header  information  in  multiple  electronic  mail  messages  and  intentionally  initiates the transmission of such messages,  commits an offence punishable, on conviction, by imprisonment for a period not exceeding [period],  or a fine not exceeding [amount], or both.
Furthermore, the text contains procedural law provisions (including advanced investigation instruments  such as the use of remote forensic tools) and provisions on the liability of Internet service providers (ISPs).
5.2.10  Pacific  In  parallel  to  the  ITU  and  EU  co-funded  project  in  the  Caribbean  the  same  organizations  launched  a  project  in  the  Pacific  (ICB4PAC).1318 The  project  aims  –  based  on  a  request  by  the  the  Pacific  Island      143   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     countries – to provide capacity building related to ICT policies and regulations.
In this regard it focuses on  building human and institutional capacity in the field of ICT through training, education and knowledge  sharing  measures.
Beneficiary  countries  are  15  Pacific  Island  countries.1319 In  March  2011  a  workshop  dealing with the current cybercrime legislation in the Pacific region was hosted in Vanuatu.1320 During the  workshop a comprehensive comparative legal analysis was presented that provided an overview about  existing legislation in the region as well as a comparison with best practices from other regions.1321 As a  follow up to this workshop a conference dealing with techniques of developing cybercrime policies and  legislation was organized in August 2011 in Samoa.1322 During the conference best practices from other  regions  were  presented  and  structures  for  a  harmonized  policy  and  legislation  were  developed.
They  addressed substantive criminal law, procedural law, international cooperation, liability of Internet Service  Provider (ISP), electronic evidence and crime prevention measures.
In April 2011 the Secretariat of the Pacific Community organized a conference related to the Fight against  Cybercrime in the Pacific.1323 The event was co-organized by the Council of Europe.
During the conference  aspects  related  to  substantive  criminal  law,  procedural  law  and  international  cooperation  were  discussed.1324    5.3   Scientific and independent approaches   Stanford Draft International Convention   5.3.1  A well-known example of a scientific approach to developing a legal framework for addressing cybercrime  at the global level is the Stanford Draft International Convention (the “Stanford Draft”).1325 The Stanford  Draft was developed as a follow-up to a conference hosted by Stanford University in the United States in  1999.1326 Comparison with the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime1327 that was drafted around  the same time shows a number of similarities.
Both cover aspects of substantive criminal law, procedural  law  and  international  cooperation.
The  most  important  difference  is  the  fact  that  the  offences  and  procedural  instruments  developed  by  the  Stanford  Draft  are  only  applicable  with  regard  to  attacks  on  information  infrastructure  and  terrorist  attacks,  while  the  instruments  related  to  procedural  law  and  international  cooperation  mentioned  in  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  can  also  be  applied with regard to traditional offences as well.1328   5.3.2  Global Protocol on Cybersecurity and Cybercrime  During  the  Internet  Governance  Forum  in  Egypt  in  2009,  Scholberg  and  Ghernaouti-Helie  presented  a  proposal for a Global Protocol on Cybersecurity and Cybercrime.1329 Article 1-5 relate to cybercrime and  recommend  the  implementation  of  substantive  criminal  law  provisions,  procedural  law  provisions,  measures  against  terrorist  misuse  of  the  Internet,  measures  for  global  cooperation  and  exchange  of  information and measures on privacy and human rights.1330 The model legislation provided in appendix to  the protocol is to a large degree (Articles 1-25) exactly based on the wording of the provisions provided by  the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.
The relationship between regional and international legislative approaches   5.4  The success of single standards with regard to technical protocols leads to the question of how conflicts  between  different  international  approaches  can  be  avoided.1331 The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime and the Commonwealth Model Law on Cybercrime are the frameworks that follow the most  comprehensive  approach,  as  they  cover  substantive  criminal  law,  procedural  law  and  international  cooperation.
But none of the instruments have so far been amended to address developments that have  taken place in recent years.
The debate at the last  UN  Crime  Congress  highlighted  the  interest  of  countries  in  international  instruments.1332 This  raises  questions in respect of the relationship between existing regional approaches and possible international  action.
If  a  new  legal  approach  defines  standards  that  are  not  in  accordance  with  the  consistent  existing  approaches at the regional and national level, this could, at least initially, have a negative effect on the   144   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     necessary  harmonization  process.
It  is  therefore  likely  that  any  new  approach  will  carefully  analyse  existing  standards  to  ensure  consistency.
One  example  is  the  criminalization  of  illegal  access  which  is  defined in a similar manner by Section 5 of the Commonwealth Model Law on Cybercrime and Article 2 of  the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.
In  addition,  a  new  approach  will  be  able  to  avoid  including  provisions  that  have  led  to  difficulties  in  implementation  or  even  stopped  countries  from  acceding  to  an  instrument.
This  provision  was  criticized  by  the  Russian  Delegation  at  the  2007  meeting  of  the  Cybercrime  Committee.1333  Finally, a new international approach could – in addition to including basic standards that are similar in  the  different  legal  approaches  –  focus  on  a  gap  analysis  to  identify  areas  that  are  not  yet  sufficiently  addressed, and thus criminalize certain cybercrime-related acts and define procedural instruments that  are not yet covered by existing instruments.
Since 2001, a number of important developments have taken  place.
When  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  was  drafted,  “phishing”,1334 “identity  theft”1335 and  offences  related  to  online  games  and  social  networks  were  not  as  relevant  as  they  have  since  become.
A  new  international  approach  could  continue  the  harmonization  process  by  including  further offences with a transnational dimension.1336   The relationship between international and national legislative approaches   5.5  As  pointed  out  previously,  cybercrime  is  a  truly  transnational  crime.1337 Having  regard  to  the  fact  that  offenders  can,  in  general,  target  users  in  any  country  in  the  world,  international  cooperation  of  law- enforcement  agencies  is  an  essential  requirement  for  international  cybercrime  investigations.
1338  Investigations  require  means  of  cooperation  and  depend  on  the  harmonization  of  laws.
Due  to  the  common principle of dual criminality,1339 effective cooperation first requires harmonization of substantive  criminal  law  provisions  in  order  to  prevent  safe  havens.1340 In  addition,  it  is  necessary  to  harmonize  investigation instruments, in order to ensure that all countries involved in an international investigation  have  the  necessary  investigative  instruments  in  place  to  carry  out  investigations.
Finally,  effective  cooperation  of  law-enforcement  agencies  requires  effective  procedures  on  practical  aspects.1341 The  importance  of  harmonization  triggers  the  need  for  participation  in  the  global  harmonization  process,  which is therefore at least a tendency, if not a necessity, for any national anti-cybercrime strategy.
Reasons for the popularity of national approaches   5.5.1  Despite the widely recognized importance of harmonization, the process of implementing international  legal  standards  is  far  from  being  completed.1342 One  of  the  reasons  why  national  approaches  play  an  important role in the fight against cybercrime is that the impact of the crimes is not the same everywhere.
One example is the approach taken to combat spam.1343 Spam-related e-mails especially affect developing  countries.
This issue was analysed in an OECD report.1344 Due to scarcer and more expensive resources,  spam turns out to be a much more serious problem in developing countries than in western countries.1345  The different impacts of cybercrime, together with existing legal structures and traditions, are the main  reasons for a significant number of legislative initiatives at the national level which are not, or only partly,  dedicated to the implementation of international standards.
International vs. national solutions   5.5.2  In times of technical globalization this may seem like a slightly surprising discussion, as anybody wishing to  connect  to  the  Internet  needs  to  make  use  of  the  (technical)  standard  protocols  in  place.1346 Single  standards  are  an  essential  requirement  for  the  operation  of  the  networks.
However,  unlike  technical  standards, the legal standards still differ.1347 It must be questioned whether national approaches can still  work,  given  the  international  dimension  of  cybercrime.1348 The  question  is  relevant  for  all  national  and  regional approaches that implement legislation which is not in line with existing international standards.
A  lack  of  harmonization  can  seriously  hinder  international  investigations,  whereas  national  and  regional      145   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     approaches  which  go  beyond  international  standards  avoid  problems  and  difficulties  in  conducting  international investigations.1349   There  are  two  main  reasons  for  a  growing  number  of  regional  and  national  approaches.
The  harmonization  process  is  therefore  often  considered to be slow compared to national and regional legislative approaches.1350 Unlike the Council of  Europe, the European Union has means to force Member States to implement framework decisions and  directives.
This is the reason why a number of European Union countries which signed the Convention on  Cybercrime  in  2001,  but  have  not  yet  ratified  it,  have  nevertheless  implemented  the  2005  EU  Council  Framework Decision on attacks against information systems.
1351 Although  it  is  unlikely  that  an  international harmonization of criminal law provisions related to offences against religious symbols would  be  possible,  a  national  approach  can  in  this  regard  ensure  that  legal  standards  in  one  country  can  be  maintained.
However, when it comes to Internet-related offences, the ability of a single country to  influence  the  offender  is  much  smaller  as  the  offender  can,  in  general,  act  from  any  place  with  a  connection to the network.1352 If they act from a country that does not criminalize the certain behaviour,  international  investigations  as  well  as  extradition  requests  will  very  often  fail.
One  of  the  key  aims  of  international legal approaches is therefore to prevent the creation of such safe havens by providing and  applying global standards.1353 As a result, national approaches in general require additional side measures  to be able to work.1354 The most popular side measures are criminalization of the user in addition to the  supplier of illegal content, and of services used in the committing a crime.
This  solution  goes  beyond  the  first  approach,  as  it  concerns businesses and organizations which offer neutral services that are used for legal as well as illegal  activities.
An example of such an approach is the United States Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement  Act of 2006.1355   Closely related to this measure is the establishment of obligations to filter certain content available on the  Internet.1356 Such an approach was discussed under the famous Yahoo-decision1357 and is currently being  discussed  in  Israel,  where  access  providers  may  be  obliged  to  restrict  access  to  certain  adult-content  websites.
Attempts to control Internet content are not limited to adult content; some countries use filter  technology to restrict access to websites that address political topics.
OpenNet Initiative1358 reports that  censorship is practised by about two dozen countries.1359         146   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response         984  This includes regional approaches.
985  The Group of Eight (G8) consists of eight countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United   States and the Russian Federation.
The presidency of the group, which represents more than 60 per cent of the world  economy (source: http://undp.org), rotates every year.
986  The idea of the creation of five subgroups – among them, one on high-tech crimes – was to improve implementation of   the 40 recommendations adopted by G8 Heads of State in 1996.
987  The establishment of the subgroup (also described as the subgroup to the “Lyon Group”) continued the efforts of the   G8 (at that time still G7) in the fight against organized crime, which started with the launch of the Senior Experts Group  on Organized Crimes (the “Lyon Group”) in 1995.
At the Halifax summit in 1995, the G8 stated: “We recognize that  ultimate success requires all Governments to provide for effective measures to prevent the laundering of proceeds  from drug trafficking and other serious crimes.
To implement our commitments in the fight against transnational  organized crime, we have established a group of senior experts with a temporary mandate to look at existing  arrangements for cooperation both bilateral and multilateral, to identify significant gaps and options for improved  coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps”.

989  “Communiqué of the Ministerial Conference of the G8 Countries on Combating Transnational Organized Crime”,   Moscow, 19-20 October 1999.
As the use of the Internet and other new technologies increase, more criminals are provided with opportunities to  commit crimes remotely, via telephone lines and data networks.
And  infrastructures such as banking and finance increasingly are becoming networked and thereby vulnerable to cyber- attack from distant locations.
Our goals are to ensure that our people are protected from those who use new technologies for criminal purposes,  such as child exploitation, financial crime, and attacks on critical infrastructures, and to ensure that no criminal receives  safe haven anywhere in the world.
We are determined that our law enforcement authorities have the technical ability  and legal processes to find criminals who abuse technologies and bring them to justice.
We direct our experts to continue their work, particularly, on problems which arise for our law enforcement authorities  from new developments in information technology and their use by criminals.
While, over the past decade, our governments have acted to see that their legal  systems account for new technologies, there remains room for improvement.
Where laws or legal processes require  enhancements, we are committed to use best efforts to fill these gaps and, consistent with fundamental national legal  principles, to promote new legal mechanisms for law enforcement to facilitate investigations and prosecutions.
Principles on Transborder Access to Stored Computer Data.
We have today  adopted certain principles for access to data stored in a foreign state, which are contained in the Annex 1 to this  Communique.
We are committed to work towards implementation of these principles through international  cooperation, including legal instruments, and through national laws and policies, and invite all nations to join in this  effort.
We note, however, that continued work is required in this area, including on the appropriate collection,  preservation and disclosure of traffic data, and we direct our experts to make further progress in consultation with  industry.
To ensure that we can all locate and identify criminals who use  networked communications for illegal purposes, we must enhance our ability to trace communications while they are  occurring and afterwards, even when those communications pass through multiple countries.
Existing processes are  often too slow and are designed more to address bilateral cooperation than crimes requiring the immediate assistance  of many countries.
We, as Ministers, direct our experts to develop, in  consultation with industry, a concrete set of options for tracing networked communications across national borders in  criminal investigations and provide those options as soon as possible within one year.
19. International Network of 24-hour Contacts.
Our 24-hour points of contact network, which allows us to respond to  fast-breaking investigations, has now been expanded from the eight G-8 countries to a number of additional countries  around the world.
The speed of electronic communications and perishability of electronic evidence requires real-time  assistance, and this growing global network has dramatically increased our investigative abilities.
We direct our experts  to facilitate further growth of this network.
G-8 nations and their partners should also use this network proactively to  notify other countries when they learn of significant potential threats to our shared networks.
Our countries have been at the forefront of efforts to successfully  tackle the ‘Millennium Bug’ or ‘Y2K Problem’, which presents a major threat to the increasingly networked global  economy.
Therefore, as part of our  new proactive use of our 24-hour network, we will provide early warning of Y2K-related abuses.
Internet Fraud.
We recognize that Internet fraud, in all of its forms, poses a significant threat to the growth and  development of electronic commerce and to the confidence that consumers place in electronic commercial  transactions.
To counter this threat, we are undertaking a comprehensive response, including crime prevention,  investigation, and prosecution.
For example, we are sharing information on international Internet fraud schemes –  including information relating to the criminals, their methods and techniques, the victims involved in these schemes,  and reports of enforcement actions – so that criminals defrauding people in multiple countries are investigated and  prosecuted for the full range of their criminal activities.
991  The idea of a 24/7 network has been picked up by a number of international approaches in the fight against cybercrime.
Such assistance shall include facilitating, or, if permitted by its domestic law and practice, directly carrying  out the following measures:  a) the provision of technical advice;  b) the preservation of data pursuant to Articles 29 and 30;   c) the collection of evidence, the provision of legal information, and locating of suspects.
The important thing about these negotiations is that  the countries involved include some major countries outside the Council of Europe and that, once signed, this  convention will be opened for signature by all States wishing to accede to it.
The idea is in fact to get a convention  which applies world-wide so that there can be no more “digital havens” or “Internet havens” in which anyone wanting  to engage in shady activities can find all the facilities they need, including financial ones, for laundering the product of  their crimes.
Since we must never lose sight of the fact that the Internet is a global system and that no country can  isolate itself from the rules under which it has to operate.”   993  G8 Government-Industry Workshop on Safety And Security In Cyberspace, Tokyo, May 2001.
994  The experts expressed their concerns regarding implementation of a data-retention obligation.
“Given the complexity  of the above noted issues blanket solutions to data retention will likely not be feasible”; Report for the workshop on  Potential Consequences for Data Retention of Various Business Models Characterizing Internet Service Providers, G8  Government-Industry Workshop on Safety And Security in Cyberspace, Tokyo, May 2001.
“Continuing to Strengthen Domestic Laws:   To truly build global capacities to combat terrorist and criminal uses of the Internet, all countries must continue to  improve laws that criminalize misuses of computer networks and that allow for faster cooperation on Internet-related  investigations.
With the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime coming into force on July 1, 2004, we should take  steps to encourage the adoption of the legal standards it contains on a broad basis.”   997  The participants expressed their intention to strengthen the instruments in the fight against cybercrime: “We discussed   the necessity of improving effective countermeasures that will prevent IT terrorism and terrorist acts in this sphere of  high technologies.
For that, it is necessary to devise a set of measures to prevent such possible criminal acts, including  in the sphere of telecommunication.
That includes work against the selling of private data, counterfeit information and  application of viruses and other harmful computer programs.
We will instruct our experts to generate unified  approaches to fighting cyber criminality, and we will need an international legal base for this particular work, and we  will apply all of that to prevent terrorists from using computer and Internet sites for hiring new terrorists and the  recruitment of other illegal actors”.

The Convention on Cybercrime shall be distributed to all Interpol member countries  in the four official languages”, available at:  www.interpol.com/Public/TechnologyCrime/Conferences/6thIntConf/Resolution.asp; The 2005 WSIS Tunis Agenda  states: “We call upon governments in cooperation with other stakeholders to develop necessary legislation for the  investigation and prosecution of cybercrime, noting existing frameworks, for example, UNGA Resolutions 55/63 and  56/121 on “Combating the criminal misuse of information technologies” and regional initiatives including, but not  limited to, the Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime”, available at:  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/internationalrel/docs/wsis/tunis_agenda.pdf; APEC called for  economies to study the Convention on Cybercrime, see: ITU Global Cybersecurity Agenda / High-Level Experts Group,  Global Strategic Report, 2008, page 18, available at:  www.itu.int/osg/csd/cybersecurity/gca/global_strategic_report/index.html; OAS called for an evaluation of the  Convention while designing Cybercrime legislation, see: ITU Global Cybersecurity Agenda / High-Level Experts Group,  Global Strategic Report, 2008, page 19, available at:  www.itu.int/osg/csd/cybersecurity/gca/global_strategic_report/index.html   1082 Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime, concerning the criminalization of acts of a racist and xenophobic   nature committed through computer systems, ETS No.
4: “The   committee drafting the Convention on Cybercrime discussed the possibility of including other content-related offences,  such as the distribution of racist propaganda through computer systems.
While there was significant support in favour of including  this as a criminal offence, some delegations expressed strong concern about including such a provision on freedom of  expression grounds.
Noting the complexity of the issue, it was decided that the committee would refer to the European  Committee on Crime Problems (CDPC) the issue of drawing up an additional Protocol to the Convention on  Cybercrime.”   1084 Regarding the principle of freedom of speech, see: Tedford/Herbeck/Haiman, Freedom of Speech in the United States,  2005; Barendt, Freedom of Speech, 2007; Baker; Human Liberty and Freedom of Speech; Emord, Freedom, Technology  and the First Amendment, 1991.

The following chapter will provide an overview of legal response to the phenomenon of cybercrime by  explaining legal approaches in criminalizing certain acts.1360 Wherever possible, international approaches  will be presented.
In cases where international approaches are lacking, examples of national or regional  approaches will be provided.
Access provider   6.1.2  Access providers play an important role as they enable users to connect to the Internet.
In cybercrime law  the  term  access  provider  is  used  both  with  regard  to  the  regulation  of  liability1364 as  well  as  the  involvement in investigations – especially the lawful interception of communication.1365 A definition of the  term is provided in the HIPCAR Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime.
(1) Access provider means any natural or legal person providing an electronic data transmission service  by  transmitting  information  provided  by  or  to  a  user  of  the  service  in  a  communication  network  or  providing access to a communication network.
[...]    The provision is broad as it covers commercial providers as well as companies that only provide access for  employees  and  operators  of  private  networks.
Caching provider   6.1.3  Caching providers provide an important service to increase the speed of access to popular content.
With  regard  to  the  need  to  regulate  the  liability1366 of  caching  providers,  the  drafters  of  the  HIPCAR  Model  Legislative Text on Cybercrime decided to include a definition.
[...]  (2) Caching provider means any natural or legal person providing an electronic data transmission service  by automatic, intermediate and temporary storing information, performed for the sole purpose of making  more efficient the information's onward transmission to other users of the service upon their request;   [...]    Just like their definition for access provider, the drafters did not limit the application of the provision to  commercial  operations.
As  a  consequence  the  provision  also  covers  companies  and  private  network  operators.
170   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response       Article 9 – Offences related to child pornography  [...]  (2)  For  the  purpose  of  paragraph  1  above,  the  term  “child  pornography”  shall  include  pornographic  material that visually depicts:        (3) For the purpose of paragraph 2 above, the term “minor” shall include all persons under 18 years of age.
A Party may, however, require a lower age-limit, which shall be not less than 16 years.
Although  the  drafters  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  emphasised  the  importance  of  a  uniform  international  standard  regarding  age1375 the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  nevertheless  permits  parties  to  require a different age limit of not lower than 16 years.
[...](4) Child pornography means pornographic material that depicts presents or represents:        this includes, but is not limited to, any audio, visual or text pornographic material.
A country may restrict the criminalisation by not implementing (b) and (c).
Definitions  of  child  pornography  are  also  contained  in  the  2011  EU  Directive  on  combating  child  pornography1379, and the 2007 Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children.1380   a) a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct;   b) a person appearing to be a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct; or  c) images representing a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct;   Computer data   6.1.6  The  increasing  use  of  computer  technology  as  well  as  the  trend  to  digitalization  of  data  led  to  an  increasing relevance of computer data.
In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:  “computer  data”  means  any  representation  of  facts,  information  or  concepts  in  a  form  suitable  for  processing in a computer system, including a program suitable to cause a computer system to perform a  function;   [...]   Similar definitions are contained in the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime1383, the 2005 EU  Council Framework Decision on attacks against information systems1384, 2008 Draft ECOWAS Directive on  Fighting Cyber Crime1385, and the 2009 HIPCAR Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime1386.
Computer data storage device   6.1.7  Storage  devices  play  an  important  role  with  regard  to  cybercrime  –  both  with  regard  to  possible  data  interference as well as with regard to the seizure of evidence.
[...]  “computer  data  storage  medium”  means  any  article  or  material  (for  example,  a  disk)  from  which  information is capable of being reproduced, with or without the aid of any other article or device;   [...]   A similar definition is contained in HIPCAR Model Legislative Text.1387    Computer system   6.1.8  In cybercrime laws the term computer system is used in relation to substantive criminal law as well as  procedural  law.
[...]   “computer  system”  means  a  device  or  a  group  of  inter-connected  or  related  devices,  including  the  Internet,  one  or  more  of  which,  pursuant  to  a  program,  performs  automatic  processing  of  data  or  any  other function;   [...]   One unusual aspect is the fact that the definition mentions “the Internet”.
The Internet is widely defined  as a system of interconnected networks.1388 From a technical perspective the Internet itself is therefore  not  a  computer  system  but  a  network  and  should  consequently  not  be  included  in  the  definition  of  computer systems but may be included in the definition of computer networks.
However, several drafters  of legal frameworks followed the example of the Commonwealth Model Law and included the Internet in  the definition of computer system.
Definitions are also contained in the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime1389, the 2005 EU  Council Framework Decision on attacks against information systems1390, 2008 Draft ECOWAS Directive on  Fighting Cyber Crime1391, and the 2009 HIPCAR Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime1392    172   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response   Critical infrastructure     6.1.9  As a consequence of an increasing use of computer and network technology in the operation of critical  infrastructure,  such  infrastructure  is  a  possible  target  for  attacks.1393 Taking  into  account  the  potential  impact of such attack, some of the more recent frameworks include a specific criminalization/aggravation  penalty for certain attacks against critical infrastructure and consequently also a definition.
[...]   (8)  Critical  infrastructure  means  computer  systems,  devices,  networks,  computer  programs,  computer  data, so vital to the country that the incapacity or destruction of or interference with such systems and  assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national or economic security, national public health  and safety, or any combination of those matters.
[...]   6.1.10  Cryptology  The use of encryption technology by offenders can seriously hinder access to relevant evidence.1394 As a  consequence several countries implemented legislation addressing the use of encryption technology and  related  investigation  instruments  of  law  enforcement.
1395 However,  out  of  the  different  regional  frameworks addressing cybercrime only the draft African Union Convention on Cyber Security1396 provides  a definition of cryptology in Article I-1.
8)  Cryptology  means  the  science  of  protecting  and  securing  information  particularly  for  the  purpose  of  ensuring confidentiality, authentication, integrity and non-repudiation;    6.1.11  Device  The term device is especially used in relation to the criminalization of “illegal devices”.1397 With regard to  the  potential  risk  that  such  devices  may  be  widely  spread  and  used  to  commit  crimes,  the  drafters  of  several regional frameworks decided to include a provision criminalizing certain activities related to illegal  devices.
Unlike the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and the Commonwealth Model Law, that  both use the term device, the HIPCAR Model Legislative contains a definition of the term in section 3.
[...]   (9) Device includes but is not limited to           [...]   a) components of computer systems such as graphic cards, memory, chips;  b) storage components such as hard drives, memory cards, compact discs, tapes;  c) input devices such as keyboards, mouse, track pad, scanner, digital cameras;   d) output devices such as printer, screens.
It is a typical descriptive definition as the provision explicitly indicates that the definition of device shall  not  be  limited  to  the  components  listed  (“includes  but  is  not  limited  to”).
With  reference  to  the  underlying provision1398 that criminalizes illegal devices the term also includes computer programs.
173   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     6.1.12  Hindering  In information societies and economies that include e-commerce the functioning of computer systems is  essential.
[...]    (10) Hinder in relation to a computer system includes but is not limited to:            a) cutting the electricity supply to a computer system; and  b) causing electromagnetic interference to a computer system; and  c) corrupting a computer system by any means; and  d)  inputting,  transmitting,  damaging,  deleting,  deteriorating,  altering  or  suppressing  computer  data.
[...]   The  definition  underlines  that  manipulations  include  physical  interference  (such  as  cutting  electrical  supply) as well as data related manipulations (such as inputting computer data).
But such a definition is included in the HIPCAR Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime.
[...]   (11) Hosting provider means any natural or legal person providing an electronic data transmission service  by storing of information provided by a user of the service.
[...]   The  definition  does  not  limit  the  application  of  the  provision  to  commercial  provider  but  also  includes  private operator.
As a consequence even the operator of a private website that enables others to store  information on the website can be covered by related liability regulations.
6.1.14  Hyperlink  While very often only hosting provider, access provider and caching provider are listed as sub-categories  to Internet Service Provider (ISP) several legal frameworks provide specific regulations for other service  such as search engines1401 and hyperlinks.
[...]   (12) Hyperlink means characteristic or property of an element such as symbol, word, phrase, sentence, or  image  that  contains  information  about  another  source  and  points  to  and  causes  to  display  another  document when executed.
[...]   (13) Interception includes but is not limited to the acquiring, viewing and capturing of any computer data  communication  whether  by  wire,  wireless,  electronic,  optical,  magnetic,  oral,  or  other  means,  during  transmission through the use of any technical device.
[...]    Interference   6.1.16  Interference is a standard term that is used in several provisions related to Cybercrime.
As a consequence a number of countries,  as  well  as  recent  model  laws,  have  included  provisions  criminalizing  acts  related  to  the  distribution  of  SPAM.1405 One  key  term  used  within  such  provision  is  “multiple  electronic  mail”.
[...]   (14) Multiple electronic mail messages mean a mail message including E-Mail and instant messaging sent  to more that thousand recipients.
[...]   (15) Remote forensic software means an investigative software installed on a computer system and used  to perform tasks that include but are not limited to keystroke logging or transmission of an IP-address.
[...]      175   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Within discussion about the use of the HIPCAR standards, which were developed for the Caribbean, in the  Pacific it was pointed out that in order to cover the full range of forensic solutions the term tool (that also  covers hardware solutions) is favourable compared to software.
In this Part:   [...]    “seize” includes:         (a) make and retain a copy of computer data, including by using onsite equipment; and  (b) render inaccessible, or remove, computer data in the accessed computer system; and  (c) take a printout of output of computer data.
This  definition  that  contains  three  sub-sections  was  further  amended  within  the  development  of  the  HIPCAR Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime.
A definition was included in section 3 (16).
[...]   (16) Seize includes:              [...]    activating any onsite computer system and computer data storage media;   making and retaining a copy of computer data, including by using onsite equipment;   maintaining the integrity of the relevant stored computer data;  rendering inaccessible, or removing, computer data in the accessed computer system;   taking a printout of output of computer data; or  seize or similarly secure a computer system or part of it or a computer-data storage medium.
a.  b.  c.  d.  e.  f.   The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime followed a different approach and included the different  elements of seizure in the provision itself.1408    6.1.20  Service provider  Service provider is a category used to describe different types of providers offering Internet services.
As  underlined above different regional frameworks include provisions addressing service provider (such as  provisions  related  to  the  liability  of  different  types  of  service  provider  or  procedural  instruments  that  require  the  support  of  law  enforcement  activities  by  a  service  provider).
Consequently,  especially  those  regional  frameworks  that  do  not  differentiate,  include  a  definition  of  the  term  service  provider.
Similar definitions are provided in the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime1412, and the 2009  HIPCAR Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime.1413   in   the  global   Substantive criminal law   6.2  Bibliography (selected): ABA International Guide to Combating Cybercrime, 2002; Aldesco, The Demise of  Anonymity:  A  Constitutional  Challenge  to  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime,  Entertainment  Law  Review,  2002;  Baker;  Human  Liberty  and  Freedom  of  Speech;  Emord,  Freedom,  Technology  and  the  First  Amendment, 1991; Bourne, 2002 Commonwealth Law Ministers Meeting: Policy Brief, page 9, available  at:  www.cpsu.org.uk/downloads/2002CLMM.pdf;  Broadhurst,  Development  law  enforcement  of  cybercrime,  in  Policing:  An  International  Journal  of  Police  Strategies  and  Management,  29(2), 2006; Brown, Mass media influence on sexuality, Journal of Sex Research, February 2002; Decker,  Cyber Crime 2.0: An Argument to Update the United States Criminal Code to Reflect the Changing Nature  of Cyber Crime, Southern California Law Review, 2008, Vol.

Crime   and   on   Cyber   2000,   available   Illegal access (hacking)   6.2.1  Since the development of computer networks, by virtue of their ability to connect computers and offer  users access to other computer systems, computers have been used by hackers for criminal purposes.1414  There  is  substantial  variation  in  hackers’  motivations.
1415 Hackers  need  not  be  present  at  the  crime  scene;1416 they just need to circumvent the protection securing the network.1417 In many cases of illegal  access, the security systems protecting the physical location of network hardware are more sophisticated  than the security systems protecting sensitive information on networks, even in the same building.1418   Illegal  access  to  computer  systems  hinders  computer  operators  in  managing,  operating  and  controlling  their  systems  in  an  undisturbed  and  uninhibited  manner.1419 The  aim  of  protection  is  to  maintain  the  integrity of computer systems.1420 It is vital to distinguish between illegal access and subsequent offences  (such  as  data  espionage1421),  since  legal  provisions  have  a  different  focus  of  protection.
In  most  cases,   178   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     illegal access (where law seeks to protect the integrity of the computer system itself) is not the end goal,  but  rather  a  first  step  towards  further  crimes,  such  as  modifying  or  obtaining  stored  data  (where  law  seeks to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the data).1422  The  question  is  whether  the  act  of  illegal  access  should  be  criminalized,  in  addition  to  subsequent  offences.1423 Analysis  of  the  various  approaches  to  the  criminalization  of  illegal  computer  access  at  the  national level shows that enacted provisions sometimes confuse illegal access with subsequent offences,  or seek to limit the criminalization of illegal access to grave violations only.1424 Some countries criminalize  mere access, while others limit criminalization only to offences where the accessed system is protected by  security  measures,  or  where  the  perpetrator  has  harmful  intentions,  or  where  data  were  obtained,  modified  or  damaged.1425 Other  countries  do  not  criminalize  the  access  itself,  but  only  subsequent  offences.1426 Opponents to the criminalization of illegal access refer to situations where no dangers were  created  by  mere  intrusion,  or  where  acts  of  “hacking”  have  led  to  the  detection  of  loopholes  and  weaknesses in the security of targeted computer systems.1427   Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime  The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  includes  a  provision  on  illegal  access  protecting  the  integrity  of  computer  systems  by  criminalizing  unauthorized  access  to  a  system.
The provision    Article 2 – Illegal access  Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal  offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the access to the whole or any part of a  computer system without right.
A Party may require that the offence be committed by infringing security  measures,  with  the  intent  of  obtaining  computer  data  or  other  dishonest  intent,  or  in  relation  to  a  computer system that is connected to another computer system.
The acts covered  The term “access” does not specify a certain means of communication, but is open-ended and open to  further  technical  developments.1430 It  shall  include  all  means  of  entering  another  computer  system,  including Internet attacks,1431 as well as illegal access to wireless networks.
Even unauthorized access to  computers  that  are  not  connected  to  any  network  (e.g.
by  circumventing  password  protection)  are  covered  by  the  provision.1432 This  broad  approach  means  that  illegal  access  not  only  covers  future  technical developments, but also covers secret data accessed by insiders and employees.1433 The second  sentence of Article 2 offers the possibility of limiting the criminalization of illegal access to access over a  network.1434   The  illegal  acts  and  protected  systems  are  thus  defined  in  a  way  that  remains  open  to  future  developments.
The Explanatory Report lists hardware, components, stored data, directories, traffic and  content-related data as examples of the parts of computer systems that can be accessed.
1435    Mental element  Like all other offences defined by the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, Article 2 requires that  the offender is carrying out the offences intentionally.1436 The Convention on Cybercrime does not contain  a  definition  of  the  term  “intentionally”.
In  the  Explanatory  Report,  the  drafters  pointed  out  that  “intentionally” should be defined at national level.1437       179   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Without right  Access to a computer can only be prosecuted under Article 2 of the Convention on Cybercrime if it takes  place “without right”.
1438 Access to a system permitting free and open access by the public or access to a  system with the authorization of the owner or other rights-holder is not “without right”.
1439 In addition to  the  subject  of  free  access,  the  legitimacy  of  security  testing  procedures  is  also  addressed.1440 Network  administrators and security companies that test the protection of computer systems in order to identify  potential  gaps  in  security  measures  were  wary  of  the  risk  of  criminalization  under  illegal  access.1441  Despite the fact that these professionals generally work with the permission of the owner and therefore  act legally, the drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime emphasized that “testing or protection of the  security of a computer system authorized by the owner or operator, [...] are with right”.1442   The fact that the victim of the crime has handed out a password or similar access code to the offender  does not necessarily mean that the offender then acted with right when accessed the victim’s computer  system.
If the offender has persuaded the victim to disclose a password or access code by means of a  successful social-engineering approach,1443 it is necessary to verify if the authorization given by the victim  covers the act carried out by the offender.1444 In general, this is not the case and the offender therefore  acts without right.
Restrictions and reservations  As an alternative to the broad approach, the Convention on Cybercrime offers the possibility of restricting  criminalization with additional elements, listed in the second sentence.1445 The procedure of how to utilize  this reservation is laid down in Article 42 of the Convention on Cybercrime.1446 Possible reservations relate  to  security  measures,1447 special  intent  to  obtain  computer  data,1448 other  dishonest  intent  that  justifies  criminal culpability, or requirements that the offence be committed against a computer system through a  network.1449 A similar approach can be found in the EU1450 Council Framework Decision on attacks against  information systems.1451    Commonwealth Model Law on Computer and Computer-related Crime  A similar approach can be found in section 5 of the 2002 Commonwealth Model Law.1452 As in the Council  of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, the provision protects the integrity of computer systems.
Illegal access 5.
A  person  who  intentionally,  without  lawful  excuse  or  justification,  accesses  the  whole  or  any  part  of  a  computer  system  commits  an  offence  punishable,  on  conviction,  by  imprisonment  for  a  period  not  exceeding [period], or a fine not exceeding [amount], or both.
European Union Council Framework Decision on attacks against iInformation systems  The  2005  EU  Council  Framework  Decision  on  attacks  against  information  systems  contains  a  provision  criminalizing illegal access to information systems in Article 2.
Article 2 – Illegal access to information systems  1.
Each  Member  State  shall  take  the  necessary  measures to  ensure that  the  intentional  access without  right to the whole or any part of an information system is punishable as a criminal offence, at least for  cases which are not minor.
Each Member State may decide that the conduct referred to in paragraph 1 is incriminated only where  the offence is committed by infringing a security measure.
180   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     All  substantive  criminal  law  provisions  of  the  framework  decision  were  drafted  in  accordance  with  the  standards  defined  by  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime.1453 The  main  difference  to  the  Convention on Cybercrime is the fact that Member States can limit criminalization to cases which are not  minor.
In  this  context,  the  framework  decision  explicitly  points  out  that  minor  cases  should  not  be  covered by the instrument.1454    Stanford Draft International Convention  The  informal1455 1999  Stanford  Draft  International  Convention  recognizes  illegal  access  as  one  of  the  offences the signatory states should criminalize.
Offenses under this Convention are committed if any person unlawfully and intentionally engages in any  of the following conduct without legally recognized authority, permission, or consent:  [...]  (c) enters into a cybersystem for which access is restricted in a conspicuous and unambiguous manner;  [...]   The acts covered  The draft provision displays a number of similarities to Article 2 of the Council of Europe Convention on  Cybercrime.
Both  require  an  intentional  act  that  is  committed  without  right/without  authority.
In  this  context,  the  requirement  of  the  draft  provision  (“without  legally  recognized  authority,  permission,  or  consent “) is more precise than the term “without right”1456 used by the Council of Europe Convention on  Cybercrime, and explicitly aims to incorporate the concept of self-defence.1457 Another difference to the  regional approaches such as the Convention on Cybercrime is the fact that the draft provision uses the  term  “cybersystem”.
It  covers  any  computer  or  network  of  computers  used  to  relay,  transmit,  coordinate  or  control  communications of data or programs.
This definition shows many similarities to the definition of the term  “computer  system”  provided  by  Article 1  a)  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime.1458  Although the Draft Convention refers to acts related to the exchange of data and does therefore primarily  focus on network-based computer systems, both definitions include interconnected computers as well as  standalone machines.1459   Illegal remaining   6.2.2  The integrity of computer systems can be violated not only by illegally entering a computer system, but  also  by  continuing  to  use  a  computer  system  after  permission  has  expired.
Since  in  such  cases  the  computer  system  was  not  accessed  illegally,  the  application  of  provisions  criminalizing  illegal  access  to  computer systems can run into difficulties.
Council of Europe  The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime criminalizes illegal access to a computer system, but not  illegal remaining in a computer system.
2 – Offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer data and systems  Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal  offences under its domestic law [when committed intentionally] the following conduct:  [...]        181   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     1bis: The intentional failure to exit a computer system, the whole or a part of which has been accessed  inadvertently without right by a person, as soon as he becomes aware of this [undue] situation.
Example  Some  of  the  recent  approaches  such  as  the  HIPCAR1460 cybercrime  legislative  text1461 include  specific  provisions to address this issue.
Like the  criminalization of illegal access, the protected legal interest is the integrity of computer systems.
Alternatively a country may require that the offence be committed by infringing  security measures or with the intent of obtaining computer data or other dishonest intent.
Remaining requires  that the offender still has access to the computer system.
Section  54  requires  that  the  offender  is  carrying  out  the  offences  intentionally.
Illegal acquisition of computer data    6.2.3  The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  as  well  as  the  Commonwealth  Model  Law  and  the  Stanford  Draft  International  Convention  provide  legal  solutions  for  illegal  interception  only.1462 It  is  questionable whether Article 3 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime applies to other cases  than those where offences are carried out by intercepting data-transfer processes.
As noted below,1463 the  question of whether illegal access to information stored on a hard disk is covered by the Convention on  Cybercrime  was  discussed  with  great  interest.1464 Since  a  transfer  process  is  needed,  it  is  likely  that  Article 3  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  does  not  cover  forms  of  data  espionage  other  than  the  interception  of  transfer  processes.1465 This  is  in  so  far  interesting  as  the  9th  Draft  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime mentioned the relevance of criminalizing data espionage.
One  issue  frequently  discussed  in  this  context  is  the  question  whether  the  criminalization  of  illegal  accesses  renders  the  criminalization  of  data  espionage  unnecessary.
In  cases  where  the  offender  has  legitimate access to a computer system (e.g.
because he/she is ordered to repair it) and on this occasion  (in violation of the limited legitimation) copies files from the system, the act is in general not covered by  the provisions criminalizing illegal access.1466   Given  that  much  vital  data  are  now  stored  in  computer  systems,  it  is  essential  to  evaluate  whether  existing mechanisms to protect data are adequate or whether other criminal law provision are necessary  to protect the user from data espionage.1467 Today, computer users can use various hardware devices and  software tools in order to protect secret information.
They can install firewalls and access-control systems  or encrypt stored information and thereby decrease the risk of data espionage.1468 Although user-friendly   182   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     devices are available, requiring only limited knowledge by users, truly effective protection of data on a  computer  system  often  requires  knowledge  that  few  users  have.1469 Data  stored  on  private  computer  systems, in particular, are often not adequately protected against data espionage.
Some  countries  have  decided  to  extend the  protection  that  is  available  through technical  measures  by  criminalizing data espionage.
Some countries follow a narrow approach  and  criminalize  data  espionage  only  where  specific  secret  information  is  obtained  –  an  example  is  18 USC § 1831, which criminalizes economic espionage.
The provision does not only cover data espionage,  but other ways of obtaining secret information as well.
(b) Organizations – Any organization that commits any offense described in subsection (a) shall be fined  not more than $10 000 000.
This § 1831 was introduced by the Economic Espionage Act of 1996.1470 Until 1996, economic espionage  was only criminalized under largely inconsistent state laws.1471 The Economic Espionage Act criminalizes  two  types  of  trade  secret  misappropriation  in  Title  18  –  theft  of  a  trade  secret  to  benefit  a  foreign  government, instrumentality, or agent; and commercial theft of trade secrets carried out for economic  advantage, whether or not it benefits a foreign government, instrumentality, or agent.1472 Although the  provision  focuses  on  the  protection  of  content  (trade  secrets)  and  does  not  require  a  specific  format  (computer  data),  it  is  not  only  relevant  with  regard  to  traditional  crime  but  also  computer-related  offences.1473 In  general,  18  U.S.C.
(1) A person who, intentionally without lawful excuse or justification or in excess of a lawful excuse or  justification obtains, for himself or for another, computer data which are not meant for him and which are  specially  protected  against  unauthorized  access,  commits  an  offence  punishable,  on  conviction,  by  imprisonment for a period not exceeding [period], or a fine not exceeding [amount], or both.
The  special  protection requires  that the hoster of the information has implemented protection measures that significantly increase the      183   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     difficulty of obtaining access to the data without authorization.
The Explanatory Notes to the legislative text point out that it is necessary that the protection  measures  go  beyond  standard  protection  measures  that  apply  to  data  as  well  as  other  property,  for  example access restrictions to certain parts of government buildings.1477   German Penal Code  A similar approach can be found in section 202a of the German Penal Code in the version in force until  2007.1478     Section 202a.
– Data Espionage:  (1) Any person who obtains without authorization, for himself or for another, data which are not meant  for him and which are specially protected against unauthorized access, shall be liable to imprisonment for  a term not exceeding three years or to a fine  (2) Data within the meaning of subsection 1 are only such as are stored or transmitted electronically or  magnetically or in any form not directly visible.
This provision covers not only economic secrets, but stored computer data in general.1479 In terms of its  objects of protection, this approach is broader compared to 18 USC § 1831 Economic espionage, but the  application of the provision is limited since obtaining data is only criminalized where data are specially  protected  against  unauthorized  access.1480 The  protection  of  stored  computer  data  under  German  criminal law is thus limited to persons or businesses that have taken measures to avoid falling victim to  such offences.1481   Relevance of such provisions  The implementation of such provision is especially relevant with regard to cases where the offender was  authorized to access a computer system (e.g.
because he/she was ordered to fix a computer problem) and  then abused the authorization to illegally obtain information stored on the computer system.1482 Having  regard to the fact that the permission covers access to the computer system, it is in general not possible  to cover such cases with provisions criminalizing the illegal access.
Without right  The application of data-espionage provisions generally requires that the data were obtained without the  consent of the victim.
The success of phishing attacks1483 clearly demonstrates the success of scams based  on the manipulation of users.1484 Due to the consent of the victim, offenders who succeed in manipulating  users  to  disclose  secret  information  cannot  be  prosecuted  on  the  basis  of  the  above-mentioned  provisions.
Illegal interception   6.2.4  The use of ICTs is accompanied by several risks related to the security of information transfer.1485 Unlike  classic  mail-order  operations  within  a  country,  data-transfer  processes  over  the  Internet  involve  numerous  providers  and  different  points  where  the  data  transfer  process  could  be  intercepted.1486 The  weakest point for intercept remains the user, especially users of private home computers, who are often  inadequately protected against external attacks.
As offenders generally always aim for the weakest point,  the risk of attacks against private users is great, all the more so given:   •  •   the development of vulnerable technologies; and   the increasing relevance of personal information for offenders.
New  network  technologies  (such  as  “wireless  LAN”)  offer  several  advantages  for  Internet  access.1487  Setting up a wireless network in a private home, for example, allows families to connect to the Internet  from anywhere inside a given radius, without the need for cable connections.
But the popularity of this  technology and resulting comfort is accompanied by serious risks to network security.
If an unprotected   184   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     wireless  network  is  available,  perpetrators  can  log  on  to  this  network  and  use  it  for  criminal  purposes  without the need to get access to a building.
They simply need to get inside the radius of the wireless  network  to  launch  an  attack.
Field  tests  suggest  that  in  some  areas  as  many  as  50  per  cent  of  private  wireless networks are not protected against unauthorized interception or access.1488 In most cases, lack of  protection arises from a lack of knowledge as to how to configure protection measures.1489  In  the  past,  perpetrators  concentrated  mainly  on  business  networks  for  illegal  interceptions.
1490  Interception of corporate communications was more likely to yield useful information than interception of  data  transferred  within  private  networks.
The  rising  number  of  identity  thefts  of  private  personal  data  suggests  that  the  focus  of  the  perpetrators  may  have  changed.1491 Private  data  such  as  credit-card  numbers, social-security numbers1492, passwords and bank account information are now of great interest  to offenders.1493    Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime  The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  includes  a  provision  protecting  the  integrity  of  non- public transmissions by criminalizing their unauthorized interception.
This provision aims to equate the  protection of electronic transfers with the protection of voice conversations against illegal tapping and/or  recording that currently already exists in most legal systems.1494    The provision   Article 3 – Illegal interception  Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal  offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the interception without right, made by  technical  means,  of  non-public  transmissions  of  computer  data  to,  from  or  within  a  computer  system,  including electromagnetic emissions from a computer system carrying such computer data.
A Party may  require that the offence be committed with dishonest intent, or in relation to a computer system that is  connected to another computer system.
1496   As mentioned above, the question whether illegal access to information stored on a hard disk is covered  by  the  provision  is  controversial  and  much  discussed.1497 In  general,  the  provision  only  applies  to  the  interception  of  transmissions  –  access  to  stored  information  is  not  considered  as  an  interception  of  a  transmission.1498 The  fact  that  the  application  of  the  provision  is  discussed  even  in  cases  where  the  offender physically accesses a standalone computer system partly arises as a result of the fact that the  Convention does not contain a provision related to data espionage,1499 and the Explanatory Report to the  Convention contains two slightly imprecise explanations with regard to the application of Article 3:  The Explanatory Report first of all points out that the provision covers communication processes taking  place within a computer system.1500 However, this still leaves open the question of whether the provision  should only apply in cases where victims send data that are then intercepted by offenders or whether it  should  apply  also  when  the  offender  operates  the  computer.
The  guide  points  out  that  interception  can  be  committed  either  indirectly  through  the  use  of  tapping  devices or “through access and use of the computer system”.1501 If offenders gain access to a computer  system and use it to make unauthorized copies of stored data on an external disc drive, whereby the act  leads  to  a  data  transfer  (sending  data  from  the  internal  to  the  external  hard  disc),  this  process  is  not  intercepted, but rather initiated, by offenders.
The missing element of technical interception is a strong  argument against the application of the provision in cases of illegal access to stored information.1502       185   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     The term “transmission” covers all data transfers, whether by telephone, fax, e-mail or file transfer.1503  The  offence  established  under  Article 3  applies  only  to  non-public  transmissions.1504 A  transmission  is  “non-public”,  if  the  transmission  process  is  confidential.1505 The  vital  element  to  differentiate  between  public  and  non-public  transmissions  is  not  the  nature  of  the  data  transmitted,  but  the  nature  of  the  transmission process itself.
Even the transfer of publicly available information can be considered criminal,  if the parties involved in the transfer intend to keep the content of their communications secret.
Use of  public networks does not exclude “non-public” communications.
Mental element   Like all other offences defined by the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, Article 3 requires that  the offender is carrying out the offences intentionally.1506 The Convention on Cybercrime does not contain  a  definition  of  the  term  “intentionally”.
These  include  action  on  the  basis  instructions or by authorization of the participants of the transmission,1509 authorized testing or protection  activities agreed to by the participants1510 and lawful interception on the basis of criminal law provisions  or in the interests of national security.1511   Another issue raised within the negotiation of the Convention on Cybercrime was the question whether  the use of cookies would lead to criminal sanctions based on Article 3.1512 The drafters pointed out that  common commercial practices (such as cookies) are not considered to be interceptions without right.1513    Restrictions and reservations:  Article 3  offers  the  option  of  restricting  criminalization  by  requiring  additional  elements  listed  in  the  second sentence, including a “dishonest intent” or relation to a computer system connected to another  computer system.
Stanford Draft International Convention  The  informal1515 1999  Stanford  Draft  International  Convention  (the  “Stanford  Draft”)  does  not  explicitly  criminalize the interception of computer data.
With  continuing  digitization,  more  critical  business  information  is  stored  as  data.1516  Attacks or obtaining of this information can result in financial losses.1517 Besides deletion, the alteration of  such  information  could  also  have  major  consequences.1518 Previous  legislation  has  in  some  cases  not  completely brought the protection of data in line with the protection of tangible objects.
This has enabled  offenders to design scams that do not lead to criminal sanctions.1519    Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime  In  Article 4,  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  includes  a  provision  that  protects  the  integrity of data against unauthorized interference.1520 The aim of the provision is to fill existing gaps in  some national penal laws and to provide computer data and computer programs with protections similar  to those enjoyed by tangible objects against the intentional infliction of damage.1521   The provision:    Article 4 – Data interference  (1) Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal  offences  under  its  domestic  law,  when  committed  intentionally,  the  damaging,  deletion,  deterioration,  alteration or suppression of computer data without right.
(2) A Party may reserve the right to require that the conduct described in paragraph 1 result in serious  harm.
The terms “damaging” and “deterioration” mean any act related  to  the  negative  alteration  of  the  integrity  of  information  content  of  data  and  programs.1522 “Deleting”  covers  acts  where  information  is  removed  from  storage  media  and  is  considered  comparable  to  the  destruction  of  a  tangible  object.
While  providing  the  definition,  the  drafters  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime did not differentiate between the various ways data can be deleted.1523 Dropping a file to the  virtual trash bin does not remove the file from the hard disk.1524 Even “emptying” the trash bin does not  necessarily remove the file.1525 It is therefore uncertain if the ability to recover a deleted file hinders the  application  of  the  provision.1526 “Suppression”  of  computer  data  denotes  an  action  that  affects  the  availability of data to the person with access to the medium, where the information is stored in a negative  way.1527 The  application  of  the  provision  is  especially  discussed  with  regard  to  denial-of-service1528  attacks.1529 During  such  an  attack,  the  data  provided  on  the  targeted  computer  system  are  no  longer  available to potential users or to the owner of the computer system.1530 The term “alteration” covers the  modification  of  existing  data,  without  necessarily  lowering  the  serviceability  of  the  data.
1531 This  act  covers  especially  the  installation  of  malicious  software  like  spyware,  viruses  or  adware  on  the  victim’s  computer.1532   Mental element  Like all other offences defined by the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, Article 4 requires that  the offender is carrying out the offences intentionally.1533 The Convention on Cybercrime does not contain  a  definition  of  the  term  “intentionally”.
In  the  Explanatory  Report,  the  drafters  pointed  out  that  “intentionally” should be defined at national level.1534    Without right  Similarly to the provisions discussed above, the acts must be committed “without right”.1535 The right to  alter data was discussed, especially in the context of “remailers”.1536 Remailers are used to modify certain  data  for  the  purpose  of  facilitating  anonymous  communications.1537 The  Explanatory  Report  mentions      187   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     that, in principle, these acts are considered a legitimate protection of privacy and can thus be considered  as being undertaken with authorization.1538    Restrictions and reservations  Article 4 offers the option of restricting criminalization by limiting it to cases where serious harm arises, a  similar approach to the EU Council Framework Decision on attacks against information systems,1539 which  enables Member States to limit the applicability of the substantive criminal law provision to “cases which  are not minor”.1540    Commonwealth Computer and Computer related Crimes Model Law   An approach in line with Article 4 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime can be found in  section 8 of the 2002 Commonwealth Model Law.1541    (a) destroys or alters data; or  (b) renders data meaningless, useless or ineffective; or  (c) obstructs, interrupts or interferes with the lawful use of data; or  (d) obstructs, interrupts or interferes with any person in the lawful use of data; or  (e) denies access to data to any person entitled to it;   The provision    Interfering with data  6.
The  coverage  of  recklessness  significantly  broadens  the  approach,  since  even  the  unintentional  deletion  of  files  from  a  computer  system or damage of a storage device will lead to criminal sanctions.
Finally, the provision contains a clarification in subsection 2  that the acts do not require permanent effect, but even temporary effects are covered.
Stanford Draft International Convention  The informal1543 1999 Stanford Draft International Convention (“Stanford Draft”) contains two provisions  that criminalize acts related to interference with computer data.
Offenses under this Convention are committed if any person unlawfully and intentionally engages in any  of the following conduct without legally recognized authority, permission, or consent:     (a) creates, stores, alters, deletes, transmits, diverts, misroutes, manipulates, or interferes with data  or programs in a cybersystem with the purpose of causing, or knowing that such activities would  cause,  said  cybersystem  or  another  cybersystem  to  cease  functioning  as  intended,  or  to  perform  functions or activities not intended by its owner and considered illegal under this Convention;   188   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response        (b) creates, stores, alters, deletes, transmits, diverts, misroutes, manipulates, or interferes with data  in a cybersystem for the purpose and with the effect of providing false information in order to cause  substantial damage to persons or property.
The acts covered  The main difference between the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and the Commonwealth  Model Law on the one hand, and the approach of the Stanford Draft on the other, is that the Stanford  Draft only criminalizes interference with data if it interferes with the functioning of a computer system  (Article  3,  paragraph  1a)  or  if  the  act  is  committed  with  the  purpose  of  providing  false  information  in  order  to  cause  damage  to  a  person  or  property  (Article  3,  paragraph  1b).
Therefore,  Therefore,  the  Stanford Draft does not criminalize the deletion of a regular text document from a data storage device as  this  neither  influences  the  functioning  of  a  computer  nor  provides  false  information.
The  Council  of  Europe Convention on Cybercrime and the Commonwealth Model Law both adopt a broader approach,  protecting the integrity of computer data without the mandatory requirement of further effects.
1548    Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime  To protect access of operators and users to ICTs, the Convention on Cybercrime includes a provision in  Article 5 that criminalizes the intentional hindering of lawful use of computer systems.1549    The provision    Article 5 – System interference  Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal  offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the serious hindering without right of the  functioning of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or  suppressing computer data.
The acts covered  The application of the provision requires that the functioning of a computer system has been hindered.1550  Hindering  means  any  act  interfering  with  the  proper  functioning  of  the  computer  system.1551 The  application  of  the  provision  is  limited  to  cases  where  hindering  is  carried  out  by  one  of  the  acts  mentioned.
In  addition,  the  provision  requires  that  the  hindering  is  “serious”.
It  is  the  parties’  responsibility  to  determine  the  criteria  to  be  fulfilled  in  order  for  the  hindering  to  be  considered  as  serious.1552 Possible restrictions under national law could include a minimum amount of damage, as well  as limitation of criminalization to attacks against important computer systems.1553  The list of acts by which the functioning of the computer system is adversely affected is conclusive.1554   Inputting is defined neither by the Convention on Cybercrime itself, nor by the drafters of the Convention  on Cybercrime.
Given that transmitting is mentioned as an additional act in Article 5, the term “inputting”  could  be  defined  as  any  act  related  to  use  of  physical  input  interfaces  to  transfer  information  to  a  computer system, whereas the term “transmitting” covers acts that entail the remote input of data.1555      189   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     The terms “damaging” and “deteriorating” overlap and are defined by the drafters of the Convention on  Cybercrime in the Explanatory Report with regard to Article 4 as negative alteration of the integrity of  information content of data and programs.1556   “Deleting” was also defined by the drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime in the Explanatory Report  with regard to Article 4, and covers acts where information is removed from storage media.1557   The  term  “alteration”  covers  the  modification  of  existing  data,  without  necessarily  lowering  the  serviceability of the data.
1558   “Suppression” of computer data denotes an action that adversely affects the availability of data to the  person with access to the medium where the information is stored.1559    Application of the provision with regard to SPAM  It was discussed whether the problem of SPAM e-mail1560 could be addressed under Article 5, since spam  can  overload  computer  systems.1561 The  drafters  stated  clearly  that  spam  may  not  necessarily  lead  to  “serious”  hindering  and  that  “conduct  should  only  be  criminalized  where  the  communication  is  intentionally  and  seriously  hindered”.1562 The  drafters  also  noted  that  parties  may  have  a  different  approach  to  hindrance  under  their  own  national  legislation,1563 e.g.
by  making  acts  of  interference  administrative offences or subject to sanction.1564    Mental elemen  Like all other offences defined by the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, Article 5 requires that  the offender is carrying out the offences intentionally.1565 This includes the intent to carry out one of listed  acts as well as the intention to seriously hinder the functioning of a computer system.
In  the  Explanatory Report, the drafters pointed out “intentionally” should be defined at national level.1566    Without right  The act needs to be carried out “without right”.1567 As mentioned previously, network administrators and  security companies testing the protection of computer systems were afraid of the possible criminalization  of their work.1568 These professionals work with the permission of the owner and therefore act legally.
In  addition, the drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime explicitly mentioned that testing the security of a  computer system based on the authorization of the owner is not without right.1569   Restrictions and reservations  Unlike  Article 2-4,  Article 5  does  not  contain  an  explicit  possibility  of  restricting  the  application  of  the  provision  implementation  in  national  law.
Nevertheless,  the  responsibility  of  the  parties  to  define  the  gravity of the offence gives them the possibility to adjust the criminalization during the implementation  process.
A  similar  approach  can  be  found  in  the  European  Union  Framework1570 Decision  on  Attacks  against Information Systems.1571    Commonwealth Computer and Computer related Crimes Model Law   An approach in line with Article 5 of the Council of  Europe Convention on Cybercrime can be found in  section 7 of the 2002 Commonwealth Model Law.1572    190   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response   (a) hinders or interferes with the functioning of a computer system; or  (b) hinders or interferes with a person who is lawfully using or operating a computer system;     The provision    Sec Interfering with computer system   7.
In subsection (1) “hinder”, in relation to a computer system, includes but is not limited to:            The main difference with the corresponding provision in the Council of Europe Convention is the fact that,  based  on  section  7  of  the  Commonwealth  Model  Law,  even  reckless  acts  are  criminalized.
Even  unintentional  cutting  of  electricity  supply  during  construction  work  can  therefore  lead  to  criminal  sanctions.
With this approach, the Model Law even goes beyond the requirements of the Convention on  Cybercrime.
(a) cutting the electricity supply to a computer system; and  (b) causing electromagnetic interference to a computer system; and  (c) corrupting a computer system by any means; and  (d) inputting, deleting or altering computer data;   European Union Coucnil Framework Decision on attacks against information systems  The EU Council Framework Decision adopts a similar approach and criminalizes illegal data interference in  Article 3.
Article 3 – Illegal system interference  Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the intentional serious hindering or  interruption of the functioning of an information system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting,  deteriorating,  altering,  suppressing  or  rendering  inaccessible  computer  data  is  punishable  as  a  criminal  offence when committed without right, at least for cases which are not minor.
The first main difference is  that, in addition to the acts covered by the Convention on Cybercrime (inputting, transmitting, damaging,  deleting, deteriorating, altering and suppressing), Article 3 also criminalizes hindering the functioning of  an  information  system  by  rendering  computer  data  inaccessible.
Data  are  rendered  inaccessible  if,  by  committing the act, the offender prevents someone from gaining access to them.
The explanation to the 19th draft version of the Convention on Cybercrime highlights that  the expert group which drafted the Convention on Cybercrime agreed that the term suppression of data  has  two  meanings:  the  deletion  of  data  so  they  no  longer  physically  exist,  and  rendering  data  inaccessible.1573    Stanford Draft International Convention  The informal1574 1999 Stanford Draft International Convention (“Stanford Draft”) contains a provision that  criminalizes acts related to interference with computer systems.
Offenses under this Convention are committed if any person unlawfully and intentionally engages in any  of the following conduct without legally recognized authority, permission, or consent:     (a) creates, stores, alters, deletes, transmits, diverts, misroutes, manipulates, or interferes with data  or programs in a cyber system with the purpose of causing, or knowing that such activities would  cause, said cyber system or another cyber system to cease functioning as intended, or to perform  functions or activities not intended by its owner and considered illegal under this Convention;   The acts covered  The main difference between the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and the Commonwealth  Model Law and the approach of the Stanford Draft is the fact that Stanford Draft covers any manipulation  of  computer  systems  while  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  and  the  Commonwealth  Model Law limit criminalization to the hindering of the functioning of a computer system.
Some  countries  have  addressed  this  problem  by  implementing  provisions  that  criminalize  the  exchange  of  pornographic  material  through  computer  systems.
However,  the  lack  of  standard  definitions  makes  it  difficult  for  law-enforcement  agencies  to  investigate those crimes, if offenders act from countries that have not criminalized the exchange of sexual  content.1576    Examples  One  example  of  the  criminalization  of  the  exchange  of  pornographic  material  is  Section  184  of  the  German Penal Code.
Section 184 Dissemination of Pornographic Writings   (1) Whoever, in relation to pornographic writings (Section 11 subsection (3)):        1. offers, gives or makes them accessible to a person under eighteen years of age;   2.  displays,  posts,  presents  or  otherwise  makes  them  accessible  at  a  place  accessible  to  persons  under eighteen years of age, or into which they can see;   3. offers or gives them to another in retail trade outside of the business premises, in kiosks or other  sales  areas  which  the  customer  usually  does  not  enter,  through  a  mail-order  business  or  in  commercial lending libraries or reading circles;   3a.
offers  or  gives  them  to  another  by  means  of  commercial  rental  or  comparable  commercial  furnishing for use, except for shops which are not accessible to persons under eighteen years of age  and into which they cannot see;   4. undertakes to import them by means of a mail-order business;   5. publicly offers, announces, or commends them at a place accessible to persons under eighteen  years of age or into which they can see, or through dissemination of writings outside of business  transactions through normal trade outlets;   6. allows another to obtain them without having been requested to do by him;   7. shows them at a public film showing for compensation requested completely or predominantly  for this showing;   8. produces, obtains, supplies, stocks, or undertakes to import them in order to use them or copies  made  from  them  within  the  meaning  of  numbers  1  through  7  or  to  make  such  use  possible  by  another; or   9. undertakes to export them in order to disseminate them or copies made from them abroad in  violation of the applicable penal provisions there or to make them publicly accessible or to make  such use possible, shall be punished with imprisonment for not more than one year or a fine.
192   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     This provision is based on the concept that trade and other exchange of pornographic writings should not  be  criminalized,  if  minors  are  not  involved.1577 On  this  basis,  the  law  aims  to  protect  the  undisturbed  development of minors.1578 Whether access to pornography has a negative impact on the development of  minors is controversial and much discussed.1579 The exchange of pornographic writings among adults is  not criminalized by Section 184.
The term “writing” covers not only traditional writings, but also digital  storage.1580 Equally,  making  them  “accessible”  not  only  applies  to  acts  beyond  the  Internet,  but  covers  cases where offenders make pornographic content available on websites.1581   One example of an approach that goes beyond this and criminalizes any sexual content is Section 4.C.1,  Philippines draft House Law Bill No.
7610, any person who in any manner advertises, promotes, or facilitates the  commission of cybersex through the use of information and communications technology such as but not  limited to computers, computer networks, television, satellite, mobile telephone, [...]  Section  3i.
:  Cybersex  or  Virtual  Sex  –  refers  to  any  form  of  sexual  activity  or  arousal  with  the  aid  of  computers or communications network     This  provision  follows  a  very  broad  approach,  as  it  criminalizes  any  kind  of  sexual  advertisement  or  facilitation  of  sexual  activity  carried  out  over  the  Internet.
Due  to  the  principle  of  dual  criminality,1583  international investigations with regard to such broad approaches run into difficulties.1584    Child pornography   6.2.8  The  Internet  is  becoming  the  main  instrument  for  the  trade  and  exchange  of  material  containing  child  pornography.1585 The major reasons for this development are the speed and efficiency of the Internet for  file transfers, its low production and distribution costs and perceived anonymity.1586 Pictures placed on a  webpage can be accessed and downloaded by millions of users worldwide.1587 One of the most important  reasons for the “success” of webpages offering pornography or even child pornography is the fact that  Internet users feel less observed while sitting in their home and downloading material from the Internet.
Unless  the  users  have  used  means  of  anonymous  communication,  the  impression  of  no  traceability  is  wrong.1588 Most Internet users are simply unaware of the electronic trail they leave while surfing.1589   The provisions criminalizing child pornography are designed in general to protect different legal interests.
Criminalization  of  the  production  of  child  pornography  seeks  to  protect  children  from  falling  victim  to  sexual  abuse.1590 With  regard  to  the  prohibition  of  acts  related  to  the  exchange  of  child  pornography  (offering, distributing) as well as possession, criminalization is intended to destroy the market, insofar as  ongoing  demand  for  new  material  could  motivate  offenders  to  continue  the  abuse  of  children.1591 In  addition, the prohibition  of  exchange  seeks  to  make  it  more  difficult  for  people to  gain access  to  such  material  and  thereby  prevent  a  trigger  effect  on  sexual  abuse  of  children.
Finally,  criminalization  of  possession intends to prevent offenders from using child-pornography material to seduce children into  getting involved in sexual intercourse.1592   Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime  In  order  to  improve  and  harmonize  the  protection  of  children  against  sexual  exploitation,1593 the  Convention on Cybercrime includes an article addressing child pornography.
The provision:    Article 9 – Offences related to child pornography  (1) Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal  offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right, the following conduct:       a) producing child pornography for the purpose of its distribution through a computer system;  b) offering or making available child pornography through a computer system;      193   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response   a) a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct;  b) a person appearing to be a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct;  c) realistic images representing a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.
(2)  For  the  purpose  of  paragraph  1  above,  the  term  “child  pornography”  shall  include  pornographic  material that visually depicts:        (3) For the purpose of paragraph 2 above, the term “minor” shall include all persons under 18 years of age.
A Party may, however, require a lower age-limit, which shall be not less than 16 years.
Even  on  the  basis  of  the  distinction  drawn  in  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime,  however,  further  differentiation  is  required.
The fact that the Convention on Cybercrime  intends  to  criminalize  the  production  of  fictive  child  pornography  –  which  does  not  require  the  actual  abuse of a child – is an argument in favour of a broad interpretation of the term “production”.
On the  other  hand,  the  Explanatory  Report  to  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  indicates  that  criminalization  of  production is required to combat the danger “at the source”.1598 While the Council of Europe Convention  on Cybercrime does not specify that intention of the drafters, the Explanatory Report to the Council of  Europe  Convention  on  the  Protection  of  Children1599 provides  a  more  specific  explanation  of  the  motivation  of  the  drafters  with  regard  to  a  similar  provision.1600 The  drafters  of  the  Convention  on  the  Protection  of  Children  highlighted  that  criminalization  of  the  production  of  child  pornography  is  “necessary  to  combat  acts  of  sexual  abuse  and  exploitation  at  their  source”.
It  is  not  necessary  that  the  material be offered on a commercial basis, but it implies that the offender offering the material is capable  of  providing  it.1602 “Making  available”  refers  to  an  act  that  enables  other  users  to  gain  access  to  child  pornography.
The act can be committed by placing child pornography on websites or connecting to file- sharing systems and enabling others to access such material in unblocked storage capacities or folders.
The  criminalization  of  possession  of  child  pornography also differs between national legal systems.1603 Demand for such material could result in its  production  on  an  ongoing  basis.1604 Possession  of  such  material  could  encourage  the  sexual  abuse  of  children, so drafters suggest that one effective way to curtail the production of child pornography is to  make possession illegal.1605 However, the Convention enables the parties, in paragraph 4, to exclude the  criminalization of mere possession, by restricting criminal liability to the production, offer and distribution  of  child  pornography.1606 Possession  involves  the  control  a  person  intentionally  exercises  towards  child  pornography.
It requires that the offender have control, which is not only the case with regard to local  storage  devices  but  also  remote  storage  devices  which  he/she  can  access  and  control.
Furthermore,  possession in general requires a mental element as stated in the definition above.
The fact that a  visual depiction is required excludes audio files.
[...]  (4) Child pornography means pornographic material that depicts presents or represents:          A country may restrict the criminalisation by not implementing (b) and (c).
a) a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct;   b) a person appearing to be a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct; or  c) images representing a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct;  this includes, but is not limited to, any audio, visual or text pornographic material.
Other countries define minors as a person under 14 years old.1613 A similar  approach is found in the 2003 EU Council Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of  children  and  child  pornography1614 and  the  2007  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  the  protection  of  children  against  sexual  exploitation  and  sexual  abuse.1615 Emphasizing  the  importance  of  a  uniform  international standard regarding age, the Convention on Cybercrime defines the term according to the UN  Convention.1616 However,  in  recognition  of  the  huge  differences  in  the  existing  national  laws,  the  Convention on Cybercrime permits parties to require a different age limit of not lower than 16 years.
One  problem  that  is  more  and  more  frequently  debated  is  potentially  unintended  criminalization  in  cases  where  the  age  of  sexual  consent  and  the  age-limit  within  the  definition  differ.1617 If,  for  example,  child  pornography is defined as visual depiction of sexual acts of a person below the age of 18 and at the same  time the age of sexual consent is 16, two 17 year old children can legally have a sexual relationship but  will be committing a serious crime (production of child pornography) if they take pictures or movies of  this act.1618    Mental element  Like all other offences defined by the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, Article 9 requires that  the offender is carrying out the offences intentionally.1619 In the Explanatory Report, the drafters explicitly  pointed  out  that  interaction  with  child  pornography  without  any  intention  is  not  covered  by  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime.
Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children  Another approach to criminalize acts related to child pornography is Article 20 of the Council of Europe  Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse.1621    The provision    Article 20 – Offences concerning child pornography  (1)  Each  Party  shall  take  the  necessary  legislative  or  other  measures  to  ensure  that  the  following  intentional conduct, when committed without right, is criminalised:               a) producing child pornography;    b) offering or making available child pornography;  c) distributing or transmitting child pornography;  d) procuring child pornography for oneself or for another person;  e) possessing child pornography;  f)  knowingly  obtaining  access,  through  information  and  communication  technologies,  to  child  pornography.
(2)  For  the  purpose  of  the  present  article,  the  term  “child  pornography”  shall  mean  any  material  that  visually depicts a child engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct or any depiction of a child’s  sexual organs for primarily sexual purposes.
(4) Each Party may reserve the right not to apply, in whole or in part, paragraph 1.f   The acts covered  The provision is based on Article 9 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and therefore to a  large  degree  comparable  to  this  provision.1622 The  main  difference  is  the  fact  that  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  focuses  on  the  criminalization  of  acts  related  to  information  and  communication  services  (“producing child pornography for the purpose of its distribution through a computer system”) while the  Convention  on  the  Protection  of  Children  mainly  takes  a  broader  approach  (“producing  child  pornography”) and even covers acts that are not related to computer networks.
Based on Article 20, paragraph 1f) of the  Convention  on  the  Protection  of  Children,  the  act  of  obtaining  access  to  child  pornography  through  a  computer  is  criminalized.
Obtaining  access  covers  any  act  of  initiating  the  process  of  displaying  information made available through ICTs.
This is the case, for example, if the offender enters the domain  name of a known child-pornography website and initiates the process of receiving the information from  the  first  page which  involves  a  necessary  automated  download  process.
Such difficulties  in  collecting  evidence  do,  for  example,  arise  if  the  offender  is  using  encryption  technology  to  protect  downloaded files on his storage media.1623 The Explanatory Report to the Convention on the Protection of  children points out that the provision should also be applicable in cases where the offender only watches  child  pornography  pictures  online  without  downloading  them.
This  can,  for  example,  occur  if  the  website  enables  streaming videos and, due to the technical configuration of the streaming process, does not buffer the  received  information  but  discards  it  straight  after  transmission  (e.g.
Commonwealth Computer and Computer-related Crimes Model Law  An approach in line with Article 9 of the Council of  Europe Convention on Cybercrime can be found in  section 10 of the 2002 Commonwealth Model Law.1626     Child pornography   10 (1) A person who, intentionally, does any of the following acts:         (a) publishes child pornography through a computer system; or  (b) produces child pornography for the purpose of its publication through a computer system; or  (c)  possesses  child  pornography  in  a  computer  system  or  on  a  computer  data  storage  medium;  commits an offence punishable, on conviction, by imprisonment for a period not exceeding [period],  or a fine not exceeding [amount], or both.1627   (2) It is a defence to a charge of an offence under paragraph (1) (a) or (1)(c) if the person establishes that  the child pornography was a bona fide scientific, research, medical or law enforcement purpose.1628  (3) In this section:  “child pornography” includes material that visually depicts:    (a) a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct; or  (b) a person who appears to be a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct; or      (c) realistic images representing a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.
“publish” includes:     (a) distribute, transmit, disseminate, circulate, deliver, exhibit, lend for gain, exchange, barter, sell  or offer for sale, let on hire or offer to let on hire, offer in any other way, or make available in any  way; or  (b) have in possession or custody, or under control, for the purpose of doing an act referred to in  paragraph (a); or  (c) print, photograph, copy or make in any other manner (whether of the same or of a different kind  or nature) for the purpose of doing an act referred to in paragraph (a).
Like  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime,  the  Commonwealth Model Law does not provide for criminalization of obtaining access to child pornography  through information technology.
Each State Party shall ensure that, as a minimum, the following acts and activities are fully covered  under its criminal or penal law, whether these offences are committed domestically or transnationally or  on an individual or organized basis:  [...]     (c)  Producing,  distributing,  disseminating,  importing,  exporting,  offering,  selling  or  possessing  for  the above purposes child pornography as defined in Article 2.
[...]      While  the  Optional  Protocol  does  explicitly  refer  to  the  role  of  the  Internet  in  distributing  such  material, 1629 it  criminalizes  acts  related  to  child  pornography  in  a  technology-neutral  way.
Child  pornography is defined as any representation, by whatever means, of a child engaged in real or simulated  explicit  sexual  activities,  or  any  representation  of  the  sexual  parts  of  a  child  for  primarily  sexual  purposes.1630 The acts covered are comparable to the acts covered in the Convention on Cybercrime, with  the exception that the provision in Article 3 was drafted so as to be technology neutral.
Stanford Draft International Convention  The informal1631 1999 Stanford Draft International Convention (the “Stanford Draft”) does not contain any  provision criminalizing the exchange of child pornography through computer systems.
The drafters of the  Stanford Draft pointed out that in general no type of speech or publication is to be treated as criminal  under the Stanford Draft.1632 Recognizing different national approaches, the drafters of the Stanford Draft  left it to the states to decide about this aspect of criminalization.1633   Solicitation of children   6.2.9  The Internet offers the possibility of communicating with others without disclosing one’s age or gender.
Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children  One  example  is  Article 23  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  the  Protection  of  Children  against  Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse.1636    198   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response       Article 23 – Solicitation of children for sexual purposes  Each Party shall take the necessary legislative or other measures to criminalise the intentional proposal,  through information and communication technologies, of an adult to meet a child who has not reached  the age set in application of Article 18, paragraph 2, for the purpose of committing any of the offences  established in accordance with Article 18, paragraph 1.a, or Article 20, paragraph 1.a, against him or her,  where this proposal has been followed by material acts leading to such a meeting.
Having regard to the increasing debate on online grooming, the drafters of the Convention decided to  include Article 23 to criminalize already preparatory acts.1637 To avoid over-criminalization, the drafter of  the Convention underlined that simple sexual chatting with a child should not be considered sufficient for  committing the act of solicitation, although this can be part of the preparation of a sexual abuse.1638   The are two main problems related to this approach.
The drafters expressed the view that  the focus on such technologies is justified since they are difficult to monitor.1639 However, no scientifically  reliable data were provided to demonstrate that the solicitation of children is a mere online problem.
The 2001 Joint Declaration on Challenges to Freedom of Expression  in the New Century, for example, points out that states should not adopt separate rules limiting Internet  content.1640  Another problem with the criminalization of this preparatory act is the fact that it might lead to conflicts  in the criminal law system, insofar as the preparation of even more serious acts is not covered.
Since the parties negotiating the Convention on Cybercrime could not  agree1646 on a common position on the criminalization of hate speech and xenophobic material, provisions  related to these offences were integrated into a separate First Protocol to the Convention.1647 One of the  main difficulties of provisions criminalizing xenophobic material is to keep a balance between ensuring  freedom of speech1648 on the one hand and preventing the violation of the rights of individuals or groups  on the other hand.
Without going into detail, the difficulties in the negotiation of the Council of Europe  Convention on Cybercrime1649 and the status of the signatures/ratifications of the Additional Protocol1650  demonstrate  that  the  different  extent  of  the  protection  of  freedom  of  speech  is  hindering  a  harmonization process.1651 Especially with regard to the common principle of dual criminality,1652 lack of  harmonization leads to difficulties in enforcement in cases with an international dimension.1653       199   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     The provision      Article 3 – Dissemination of racist and xenophobic material through computer systems  1.
Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal  offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right, the following conduct:  distributing,  or  otherwise  making  available,  racist  and  xenophobic  material  to  the  public  through  a  computer system.
Article 4 – Racist and xenophobic motivated threat  Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal  offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right, the following conduct:  threatening,  through  a  computer  system,  with  the  commission  of  a  serious  criminal  offence  as  defined  under  its  domestic  law,  (i)  persons  for  the  reason  that  they  belong  to  a  group,  distinguished  by  race,  colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as religion, if used as a pretext for any of these factors,  or (ii) a group of persons which is distinguished by any of these characteristics.
Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal  offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right, the following conduct:  insulting  publicly,  through  a  computer  system,  (i)  persons  for  the  reason  that  they  belong  to  a  group  distinguished by race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as religion, if used as a pretext  for any of these factors; or (ii) a group of persons which is distinguished by any of these characteristics.
A Party may either:     a. require that the offence referred to in paragraph 1 of this article has the effect that the person or  group of persons referred to in paragraph 1 is exposed to hatred, contempt or ridicule; or  b. reserve the right not to apply, in whole or in part, paragraph 1 of this article.
Each Party shall adopt such legislative measures as may be necessary to establish the following conduct  as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right:  distributing  or  otherwise  making  available,  through  a  computer  system  to  the  public,  material  which  denies, grossly minimises, approves or justifies acts constituting genocide or crimes against humanity, as  defined  by  international  law  and  recognised  as  such  by  final  and  binding  decisions  of  the  International  Military Tribunal, established by the London Agreement of 8 August 1945, or of any other international  court established by relevant international instruments and whose jurisdiction is recognised by that Party.
A Party may either     a.  require  that  the  denial  or  the  gross  minimisation  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  of  this  article  is  committed  with  the  intent  to  incite  hatred,  discrimination  or  violence  against  any  individual  or  group of individuals, based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as religion if  used as a pretext for any of these factors, or otherwise  b. reserve the right not to apply, in whole or in part, paragraph 1 of this article.
Based  on  the  definition  provided  by  Article 2,  racist  and  xenophobic  material  is  any  written  material,  image  or  any  other  representation  of  ideas  or  theories  which  advocates,  promotes  or  incites  hatred,  discrimination  or  violence,  against  any   200   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     individual or group of individuals, based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as  religion  if  used  as  a  pretext  for  any  of  these  factors.
“Distribution”  means  the  active  dissemination  of  material.1655 “Making available” covers the act of placing material online.1656 It requires that users can gain  access to the material.
The act can be committed by placing material on websites or connecting to file- sharing systems and enabling others to access such material in unblocked storage capacities or folders.
1657 Since hyperlinks only facilitate the access to material, such an interpretation goes beyond the text of  the  provision.
Criminalization requires in addition that the distribution and making available include an interaction with  the public, and thereby excludes private communication.1658  Article 6 follows a similar approach to Article 3, criminalizing distributing or making available, through a  computer  system  to  the  public,1659 material  which  denies,  grossly  minimizes,  approves  or  justifies  acts  constituting genocide or crimes against humanity, as defined by international law and recognized as such  by final and binding decisions of the International Military Tribunal, established by the London Agreement  of  8 August  1945,  or  of  any  other  international  court  established by  relevant  international  instruments  and whose jurisdiction is recognized by that Party.
Article 4 criminalizes threatening persons, through a computer system, with the commission of a serious  criminal  offence,  for  the  reason  that  they  belong  to  a  group,  distinguished  by  race,  colour,  descent  or  national or ethnic origin, as well as religion, or a group of persons which is distinguished by any of these  characteristics.
It refers to threats which create fear in the persons at whom they are directed that they  will suffer the commission of an offence.1660 The term “threatening”, unlike Article 3, does not require any  interaction with the public and therefore also covers sending out e-mails to the victim.
Article 5  adopts  a  similar  approach  to  Article 4,  criminalizing  insulting  persons  for  the  reason  that  they  belong to a group distinguished by race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as religion, if  used as a pretext for any of these factors, or a group of persons which is distinguished by any of these  characteristics.
“Insulting” refers to any offensive or invective expression which prejudices the dignity of a  person and is directly connected with the insulted person’s belonging to the group.
The  main  difference  between  Article 4  and  Article 5  is  the  fact  that the  provision  only  requires  publicly  insulting,  and therefore excludes private communication (such as e-mail).1662   Stanford Draft International Convention  The informal1663 1999 Stanford Draft International Convention (the “Stanford Draft”) does not include a  provision criminalizing hate speech.
It is pointed out in the 2006 Joint Declaration of  the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression, the OSCE Representative on Freedom  of  the  Media  and  the  OAS  Special  Rapporteur  on  Freedom  of  Expression  that  in  “many  countries,  overbroad  rules  in  this  area  are  abused  by  the  powerful  to  limit  non-traditional,  dissenting,  critical,  or  minority  voices,  or  discussion  about  challenging  social  issues”.1667 The  2008  Joint  Declaration  highlights  that  international  organizations,  including  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  and  Human  Rights  Council,  should  resist  from  the  further  adoption  of  statements  supporting  the  idea  of  criminalizing  defamation of religions.
The provisions    Article 4 – Racist and xenophobic motivated threat  Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal  offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right, the following conduct:  threatening,  through  a  computer  system,  with  the  commission  of  a  serious  criminal  offence  as  defined  under  its  domestic  law,  (i)  persons  for  the  reason  that  they  belong  to  a  group,  distinguished  by  race,  colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as religion, if used as a pretext for any of these factors,  or (ii) a group of persons which is distinguished by any of these characteristics.
Each  Party  shall  adopt  such  legislative  and  other  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  establish  as  criminal  offences  under  its  domestic  law,  when  committed  intentionally  and  without  right,  the  following  conduct:  insulting  publicly,  through  a  computer  system,  (i)  persons  for  the  reason  that  they belong to a group distinguished by race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as  religion, if used as a pretext for any of these factors; or (ii) a group of persons which is distinguished  by any of these characteristics.
The provisions criminalize threats and insults to people for the reason  that they belong to a group.
Defiling etc, of copy of Holy Quran – Whoever, using any electronic system or electronic device wilfully  defiles,  damages  or  desecrates  a  copy  of  the  Holy  Quran  or  of  an  extract  there  from  or  uses  it  in  any  derogatory manner or for any unlawful purpose shall be punished with imprisonment of life.
Use of derogatory remarks etc, in respect of the Holy Prophet – Whoever, using any electronic system  or electronic device by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation, or by any imputation,  innuendo, or insinuation, directly or indirectly, defiles the sacred name of the Holy Prophet Mohammed  (peace be upon him) shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life and shall be liable to fine.
As with provisions criminalizing the distribution of xenophobic material via the Internet, one of the main  challenges of global approaches criminalizing religious offences is the principle of freedom of speech.1672  As pointed out previously, the different extent of protection of freedom of speech is a hindrance for the  harmonization process.1673 Especially with regard to the common principle of dual criminality,1674 the lack  of harmonization leads to difficulties in enforcement in cases with an international dimension.1675   Illegal gambling    6.2.12  The  growing  number  of  websites  offering  illegal  gambling  is  a  concern,1676 as  they  can  be  used  to  circumvent the prohibition on gambling in force in some countries.1677 If services are operated from places  that do not prohibit online gambling, it is difficult for countries that criminalize the operation of Internet  gambling to prevent their citizens from using these services.1678    Example from national legislation  The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime does not contain a prohibition of online gambling.
One  example of a national approach in this regard is section 284 German Penal Code:   Example    Section 284 Unauthorized Organization of a Game of Chance   (1) Whoever, without the permission of a public authority, publicly organizes or runs a game of chance or  makes  the  equipment  therefore  available,  shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  for  not  more  than  two  years or a fine.
(2) Games of chance in clubs or private parties in which games of chance are regularly organized shall  qualify as publicly organized.
The  provision  intends  to  limit  the  risks  of  addiction1679 to  gambling  by  defining  procedures  for  the  organization  of  such  games.1680 It  does  not  explicitly  focus  on  Internet-related  games  of  chance,  but  includes  them  as  well.1681 In  this  regard,  it  criminalizes  the  operation  of  illegal  gambling,  without  the  permission  of  the  competent  public  authority.
In  addition,  it  criminalizes  anyone  who  (intentionally)  makes equipment available that is then used for illegal gambling.1682 This criminalization goes beyond the  consequences of aiding and abetting, as offenders can face higher sentences.1683   To  avoid  criminal  investigations,  the  operator  of  illegal  gambling  websites  can  physically  move  their  activities1684 to countries that do not criminalize illegal gambling.1685 Such move to locations is a challenge  for  law-enforcement  agencies  because  the  fact  that  a  server  is  located  outside  the  territory  of  a  country1686 does not in general affect the possibilities of users inside the country to access it.1687 In order  to  improve  the  ability  of  law-enforcement  agencies  to  fight  against  illegal  gambling,  the  German  Government  has  extended  the  criminalization  to  users.1688 Based  on  section 285,  law-enforcement  agencies  can  prosecute  users  who  participate  in  illegal  gambling  and  can  initiate  investigations  even  where operators of games of chance cannot be prosecuted, if they are located outside Germany:        203   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Section 285 Participation in an Unauthorized Game of Chance   Whoever participates in a public game of chance (Section 284) shall be punished with imprisonment for  not more than six months or a fine of not more than one hundred eighty daily rates.
If  offenders  use  gambling  sites  for  money-laundering  activities,  the  identification  of  offenders  is  often  difficult.1689 One example of an approach1690 to prevent illegal gambling and money-laundering activities is  the United States Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2005.1691     § 5363.
Prohibition on acceptance of any financial instrument for unlawful Internet gambling   No person engaged in the business of betting or wagering may knowingly accept, in connection with the  participation of another person in unlawful Internet gambling   (1)  credit,  or  the  proceeds  of  credit,  extended  to  or  on  behalf  of  such  other  person  (including  credit  extended through the use of a credit card);   (2) an electronic fund transfer, or funds transmitted by or through a money transmitting business, or the  proceeds  of  an  electronic  fund  transfer  or  money  transmitting  service,  from  or  on  behalf  of  such  other  person;   (3)  any  check,  draft,  or  similar  instrument  which  is  drawn  by  or  on  behalf  of  such  other  person  and  is  drawn on or payable at or through any financial institution; or   (4) the proceeds of any other form of financial transaction, as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation,  which involves a financial institution as a payor or financial intermediary on behalf of or for the benefit of  such other person.
Policies and procedures to identify and prevent restricted transactions   (a) Before the end of the 270-day period beginning on the date of the enactment of this subchapter, the  Secretary, in consultation with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Attorney  General,  shall  prescribe  regulations  requiring  each  designated  payment  system,  and  all  participants  therein,  to  identify  and  prevent  restricted  transactions  through  the  establishment  of  policies  and  procedures  reasonably  designed  to  identify  and  prevent  restricted  transactions  in  any  of  the  following  ways:        (A)  allow  the  payment  system  and  any  person  involved  in  the  payment  system  to  identify  restricted transactions by means of codes in authorization messages or by other means; and   (B) block restricted transactions identified as a result of the policies and procedures developed  pursuant to subparagraph (A).
(b) In prescribing regulations under subsection (a) the Secretary shall      (1)  identify  types  of  policies  and  procedures,  including  nonexclusive  examples,  which  would  be  deemed, as applicable, to be reasonably designed to identify, block, or prevent the acceptance of  the products or services with respect to each type of restricted transaction;   (2) to the extent practical, permit any participant in a payment system to choose among alternative  means  of  identifying  and  blocking,  or  otherwise  preventing  the  acceptance  of  the  products  or  services of the payment system or participant in connection with, restricted transactions; and   (3)  consider  exempting  restricted  transactions  from  any  requirement  imposed  under  such  regulations,  if  the  Secretary  finds  that  it  is  not  reasonably  practical  to  identify  and  block,  or  otherwise prevent, such transactions.
(c) A financial transaction provider shall be considered to be in compliance with the regulations prescribed  under subsection (a), if     (1) such person relies on and complies with the policies and procedures of a designated payment  system of which it is a member or participant to                    204   (A) identify and block restricted transactions; or   (B)  otherwise  prevent  the  acceptance  of  the  products  or  services  of  the  payment  system,  member, or participant in connection with restricted transactions; and   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response        (2) such policies and procedures of the designated payment system comply with the requirements of  regulations prescribed under subsection (a).
(e) The requirements of this section shall be enforced exclusively by the Federal functional regulators and  the Federal Trade Commission, in the manner provided in section 505(a) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.
(b) Upon conviction of a person under this section, the court may enter a permanent injunction enjoining  such person from placing, receiving, or otherwise making bets or wagers or sending, receiving, or inviting  information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers.
The intention of the act is to address the challenges and threats of (cross-border) Internet gambling.1692  The act contains two important regulations.
First, it prohibits acceptance of any financial instrument for  unlawful Internet gambling by any person engaged in the business of betting or wagering.
This provision  does not regulate action undertaken by the user of Internet gambling sites or financial institutions.1693 A  violation  of  this  prohibition  can  lead  to  criminal  sanctions.1694 Second,  it  requires  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to prescribe regulations that require  financial transaction providers to identify and block restricted transactions in connection with unlawful  Internet gambling through reasonable policies and procedures.
Unlike  the  acceptance  of  financial  instruments  for  unlawful  Internet  gambling  by  persons  engaged  in  the  business of betting or wagering, financial institutions do not in general face criminal liability.
With regard  to the international impact of the regulation, potential conflicts with the General Agreement on Trade in  Services (GATS)1695 are currently being investigated.1696    6.2.13  Libel and defamation  Libel and the publication of false information are not acts that are exclusively committed on networks.
But  as  pointed  out  previously,  the  possibility  of  anonymous  communication1697 and  logistic  challenges  related  to  the  huge  amount  of  available  information  in  the  Internet1698 are  abstract  parameters  that  support those acts.
The question whether this requires criminalization of defamation is controversial.1699 Concerns regarding  the  criminalization  of  defamation  are  especially  related  to  potential  conflict  with  the  principle  of  “freedom  of  speech”.
Thus,  a  number  of  organizations  have  called  for  a  replacement  of  criminal  defamation  laws.1700 The  UN  Special  Rapporteur  on  Freedom  of  Opinion  and  Expression  and  the  OSCE  Representative on Freedom of the Media have stated: “Criminal defamation is not a justifiable restriction  on  freedom  of  expression;  all  criminal  defamation  laws  should  be  abolished  and  replaced,  where  necessary, with appropriate civil defamation laws”.
Despite  these  concerns,  some  countries1701 have  implemented  criminal  law  provisions  that  criminalize  libel, as well as the publication of false information.
Their application is not limited to  certain  means  of  communication,  so  it  can  cover  acts  committed  within  the  network,  as  well  as  acts  committed outside the network.
6.2.14  Spam  Having regard to the fact that up to 75 per cent1706 of all e-mails are reported to be spam1707 e-mails, the  need  for  criminal  sanctions  on  spam  e-mails  has  been  discussed  intensively.1708 National  legislative  solutions  addressing  spam  differ.1709 One  of  the  main  reasons  why  spam  is  still  a  problem  is  that  filter  technology  still  cannot  identify  and  block  all  spam  e-mails.1710 Protection  measures  offer  only  limited  protection against unsolicited e-mails.
In  2005,  OECD  published  a  report  that  analysed  the  impact  of  spam  for  developing  countries.1711 The  report  points  out  that  representatives  from  developing  countries  often  express  the  view  that  Internet  users in their countries are suffering much more from the impact of spam and net abuse.
Due  to  the  more  limited  and  more  expensive  resources,  spam  turns  out  to  be  a  much  more  serious  issue  in  developing  countries than in western countries.1712   However,  it  is  not  only  the  identification  of  spam  e-mail  that  poses  problems.
The current trend towards computer-based transmission (including e-mail and VoIP) highlights  the importance of protecting communications from attack.
206   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime  The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  does  not  explicitly  criminalize  spam.1713 The  drafters  suggested that the criminalization of such acts should be limited to serious and intentional hindering of  communication.1714 This approach does not focus on unsolicited e-mails, but on the effects on a computer  system  or  network.
According  to  the  legal  approach  adopted  in  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime, the fight against spam can only be based on unlawful interference with computer networks  and systems:    Article 5 – System interference  Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal  offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the serious hindering without right of the  functioning of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or  suppressing computer data.
Stanford Draft International Convention  The informal1715 1999 Stanford Draft Convention does not include a provision criminalizing spam.
(1) A person who, intentionally, without lawful excuse or justification or in excess of a lawful excuse or  justification:      a. initiates the transmission of multiple electronic mail messages from or through such computer  system; or  b. uses a protected computer system to relay or retransmit multiple electronic mail messages, with  the intent to deceive or mislead users, or any electronic mail or Internet service provider, as to the  origin of such messages, or  c.  materially  falsifies  header  information  in  multiple  electronic  mail  messages  and  intentionally  initiates  the  transmission  of  such  messages,  commits  an  offence  punishable,  on  conviction,  by  imprisonment for a period not exceeding [period], or a fine not exceeding [amount], or both.
section 3(14) defines multiple electronic mail messages as a mail  message, including e-mail and instant messaging, sent to more than a thousand recipients.
In this context,  the Explanatory Note points out that the limitation of criminalization to acts carried out without lawful  excuse  or  justification  plays  an  important  role  in  distinguishing  between  legitimate  mass  mailings  (like  newsletters) and illegal spam.1718 Section 15 (1) (b) criminalizes the circumvention of anti-spam technology  by abusing protected computer systems to relay or transmit electronic messages.
Section 15 (1) (c) covers  the  circumvention  of  anti-spam  technology  by  falsifying  header  information.
The  Explanatory  Note  highlights  that  section 15  requires  that  the  offender  carries  out  the  offences  intentionally  and  without  lawful excuse or justification.
Fraud and related activity in connection with electronic mail  (a) In General – Whoever, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly –     initiates  the   intentionally   (1)  accesses  a  protected  computer  without  authorization,  and  transmission of multiple commercial electronic mail messages from or through such computer,  (2) uses a protected computer to relay or retransmit multiple commercial electronic mail messages,  with the intent to deceive or mislead recipients, or any Internet access service, as to the origin of  such messages,  (3)  materially  falsifies  header  information  in  multiple  commercial  electronic  mail  messages  and  intentionally initiates the transmission of such messages,  (4) registers, using information that materially falsifies the identity of the actual registrant, for five  or  more  electronic  mail  accounts  or  online  user  accounts  or  two  or  more  domain  names,  and  intentionally initiates the transmission of multiple commercial electronic mail messages from any  combination of such accounts or domain names, or  (5)  falsely  represents  oneself  to  be  the  registrant  or  the  legitimate  successor  in  interest  to  the  registrant of 5 or more Internet Protocol addresses, and intentionally initiates the transmission of  multiple commercial electronic mail messages from such addresses,  or conspires to do so, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b).
(b) Penalties – The punishment for an offense under subsection (a) is–       (1) a fine under this title, imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or both, if–   (A) the offense is committed in furtherance of any felony under the laws of the United States or  of any State; or  (B) the defendant has previously been convicted under this section or section 1030, or under the  law of any State for conduct involving the transmission of multiple commercial electronic mail  messages or unauthorized access to a computer system;     The provision was implemented by the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003.1721 The intention of the act was to create a  single  national  standard  designed  to  control  commercial  e-mail.1722 It  applies  to  commercial  electronic  messages, but not to messages relating to transactions and existing business relationships.
The regulatory  approach  requires  that  commercial  electronic  messages  include  an  indication  of  solicitation,  including  opt-out instructions and the physical address of the sender.1723 18 USC.
§ 1037 criminalizes the senders of  spam  e-mails  especially  information  of  e-mails  to  circumvent  filter  technology.1724 In addition, the provision criminalizes unauthorized access to a protected computer and  initiation of the transmission of multiple commercial electronic mail messages.
if  they  falsify  the  header   6.2.15  Misuse of devices  Another  serious  issue  is  the  availability  of  software  and  hardware  tools  designed  to  commit crimes.1725  Apart from the proliferation of “hacking devices”, the exchange of passwords that enables unauthorized  users to access computer systems is a serious challenge.1726 The availability and potential threat of these  devices makes it difficult to focus criminalization on the use of these tools to commit crimes only.
One approach to fight against the distribution of such  devices is criminalization of the production of the tools.
1727   Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime  Taking  into  account  other  Council  of  Europe  initiatives,  the  drafters  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  established an independent criminal offence for specific illegal acts regarding certain devices or access to   208   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     data  to  be  misused  for  the  purposes  of  committing  offences  against  the  confidentiality,  integrity  and  availability of computer systems or data:1728   The provision    Article 6 – Misuse of devices  (1) Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal  offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right:       (a) the production, sale, procurement for use, import, distribution or otherwise making available of:  (i)  a  device,  including  a  computer  program,  designed  or  adapted  primarily  for  the  purpose of  committing any of the offences established in accordance with the above Articles 2 through 5;  (ii)  a  computer  password,  access  code,  or  similar  data  by  which  the  whole  or  any  part  of  a  computer  system  is  capable  of  being  accessed,  with  intent  that  it  be  used  for  the  purpose  of  committing any of the offences established in Articles 2 through 5; and          (b) the possession of an item referred to in paragraphs a) i or ii above, with intent that it be used for  the  purpose  of  committing  any  of  the  offences  established  in  Articles 2  through  5.
A  Party  may  require by law that a number of such items be possessed before criminal liability attaches.
The objects covered  Paragraph 1(a) identifies both the devices1729 designed to commit and promote cybercrime and passwords  that enable access to a computer system.
The term “devices” covers hardware as well as software-based  solutions  to  commit  one  of  the  mentioned  offences.
The  Explanatory  Report  mentions  for  example  software such as virus programs, or programs designed or adapted to gain access to computer systems.1730  “Computer  password,  access  code,  or  similar  data”,  unlike  devices,  do  not  perform  operations,  but  constitute access codes.
One question discussed in this context is the question whether the publication of  system vulnerabilities is covered by the provision.1731 Unlike classic access codes, system vulnerabilities do  not necessarily enable immediate access to a computer system, but enable the offender to make use of  the vulnerabilities to successfully attack a computer system.
In  addition  to  production,  it  also  sanctions  the  sale,  procurement  for  use,  import,  distribution  or  other  availability  of  devices  and  passwords.
A  similar  approach  (limited  to  devices  designed  to  circumvent  technical  measures)  can  be  found  in  EU  legislation  on  the  harmonization  of  copyrights, 1732 and  a  number  of  countries  have  implemented  similar  provisions  in  their  criminal  law.1733 “Distribution”  covers  active  acts  of  forwarding  devices or passwords to others.1734 In the context of Article 6, “sale” describes activities involved in selling  the devices and passwords in return for money or other compensation.
“Procurement for use” covers acts  related to the active obtaining of passwords and devices.1735 The fact that the act of procuring is linked to  the use of such tools generally requires intent on the part of the offender to procure the tools for a use  that  goes  beyond  the  “regular”  intent,  i.e.
“Import” covers acts of obtaining devices and access codes  from foreign  countries.1736 As a result, offenders that import such tools to sell them can be prosecuted  even  before  they  offer  the  tools.
“Making      209   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     available”  refers  to  an  act  that  enables  other  users  to  get  access  to  items.1737 The  Explanatory  Report  suggests  that  the  term  “making  available”  is  also  intended  to  cover  the  creation  or  compilation  of  hyperlinks in order to facilitate access to such devices.
1738    Dual use tools  Unlike the European Union approach to the harmonization of copyrights,1739 the provision does not only  apply  to  devices  that  are  exclusively  designed  to  facilitate  committing  cybercrime;  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime also covers devices that are generally used for legal purposes, where the offenders’ specific  intent is to commit cybercrime.
In the Explanatory Report, the drafters suggested that the limitation to  devices designed solely to commit crimes was too narrow and could lead to insurmountable difficulties of  proof  in  criminal  proceedings,  rendering  the  provision  virtually  inapplicable  or  only  applicable  in  rare  instances.1740   To  ensure  the  proper  protection  of  computer  systems,  experts  use  and  possess  various  software  tools  that  could  make  them  a  possible  focus  of  law  enforcement.
Apart  from  this,  criminalization  of  the  possession  of  these  devices  is  limited  by  the  requirement of intent to use the device to commit a crime as set out in Article 2 to 5 of the Convention on  Cybercrime.1742 The  Explanatory  Report  points  out  that  this  special  intent  was  included  to  “avoid  the  danger  of  over-criminalisation  where  devices  are  produced  and  put  on  the  market  for  legitimate  purposes, e.g.
Criminalization of possession  Paragraph  1,  sub-paragraph  (b)  takes  the  regulation  in  paragraph  1,  sub-paragraph  (a)  further,  by  criminalizing  the  possession  of  devices  or  passwords,  if  linked  to  the  intent  to  commit  cybercrime.
Criminalization  of  the  possession  of  tools  is  controversial.1744 Article 6  is  not  limited  to  tools  that  are  designed  exclusively  for  committing  crimes,  and  opponents  of  criminalization  are  concerned  that  criminalization  of  the  possession  of  these  devices  could  create  unacceptable  risks  for  system  administrators  and  network-security  experts.1745 The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  enables  the  parties  to  require that a certain number of such items be possessed before criminal liability attaches.
Mental element  Like all other offences defined by the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, Article 6 requires that  the offender is carrying out the offences intentionally.1746 In addition to the regular intent with regard to  the acts covered, Article 6 of the Convention on Cybercrime requires an additional specific intent that the  device  is  used  for  the  purpose  of  committing  any  of  the  offences  established  in  Article 2-5  of  the  Convention.1747    Without right  Similarly to the provisions discussed above, the acts must be committed “without right”.1748 With regard  to  the  fears  that  the  provision  could  be  used  to  criminalize  the  legitimate  operation  of  software  tools  under self-protection measures.
the drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime pointed out that such acts  are not considered as being carried out “without right”.1749    Restrictions and reservations  Due  to  the  debate  on  the  need  for  criminalization  of  the  possession  of  devices,  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime offers the option of a complex reservation in Article 6, paragraph 3 (in addition to paragraph  1,  sub-paragraph  (b),  sentence  2).
9 of  the 2002 Commonwealth Model Law.1751     Illegal devices   9.
(1) A person commits an offence if the person:     (a)  intentionally  or  recklessly,  without  lawful  excuse  or  justification,  produces,  sells,  procures  for  use, imports, exports, distributes or otherwise makes available:   (i)  a  device,  including  a  computer  program,  that  is  designed  or  adapted  for  the  purpose  of  committing an offence against section 5, 6, 7 or 8; or  (ii)  a  computer  password,  access  code  or  similar  data  by  which  the  whole  or  any  part  of  a  computer system is capable of being accessed;  with the intent that it be used by any person for the purpose of committing an offence against  section 5, 6, 7 or 8; or               (b) has an item mentioned in subparagraph (i) or (ii) in his or her possession with the intent that it  be used by any person for the purpose of committing an offence against section 5, 6, 7 or 8.
While the devices covered by the provision and the acts mentioned are the same, the main difference  from  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  is  the  fact  that  the  Commonwealth  Model  Law  criminalizes reckless acts in addition to intentional acts, while the Convention on Cybercrime requires an  intention in all cases.
During negotiation of the Commonwealth Model Law, further amendments to the  provision  that  criminalize  the  possession  of  such  devices  were  discussed.
The  expert  group  suggested  criminalization  of  offenders  possessing  more  than  one  item.1752 Canada  proposed  a  similar  approach  without predefining the number of items that would lead to criminalization.
1753    Stanford Draft International Convention  The  informal1754 1999  Stanford  Draft  International  Convention  (“Stanford  Draft”)  includes  a  provision  criminalizing acts related to certain illegal devices.
Offenses under this Convention are committed if any person unlawfully and intentionally engages in any  of the following conduct without legally recognized authority, permission, or consent:  [...]     (e) manufactures, sells, uses, posts, or otherwise distributes any device or program intended for the  purpose of committing any conduct prohibited by Articles 3 and 4 of this Convention;     The drafters of the Stanford Draft pointed out that in general no type of speech, or publication, is to be  treated  as  criminal  under  the  Stanford  Draft.1755 The  only  exemption  they  make  relates  to  illegal  devices.1756 In  this  context,  the  drafters  highlighted  that  criminalization  should  be  limited  to  the  acts  mentioned and, for example, not cover the discussion of system vulnerabilities.1757    HIPCAR Cybercrime Legislative Text  An interesting approach can be found in the legislative text developed by the beneficiary states within the  HIPCAR initiative.1758         211   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Illegal Devices   10.
[...]   (3) A country may decide not to criminalize the mere unauthorized access provided that other effective  remedies are available.
Furthermore, a country may decide to limit the criminalization to devices listed in a  Schedule.
In  order  to  prevent  over-criminalization,  the  drafter  decided  to  include  the  possibility  of  limiting  the  criminalization by introducing a blacklist.
In this case, only devices contained in the list are covered by the  provision.
Such an approach limits the risks of criminalizing acts that are desirable from the point of view  of cybersecurity.
However, maintaining such a list would very likely require significant resources.
The  drafters  decided  to  implement  minimum  standards  and  protect  the  security  and  reliability  of  electronic  data  by  creating  a  parallel  offence  to  the  traditional  forgery  of  tangible documents to fill gaps in criminal law that might not apply to electronically stored data.1763    The provision    Article 7 – Computer-related forgery  Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal  offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right, the input, alteration,  deletion,  or  suppression  of  computer  data,  resulting  in  inauthentic  data  with  the  intent  that  it  be  considered or acted upon for legal purposes as if it were authentic, regardless whether or not the data is  directly  readable  and  intelligible.
A  Party  may  require  an  intent  to defraud,  or  similar  dishonest  intent,  before criminal liability attaches.
Computer data is defined by the Convention on Cybercrime1764 as “any representation  of  facts,  information  or  concepts  in  a  form  suitable  for  processing  in  a  computer  system,  including  a  program suitable to cause a computer system to perform a function”.
Article  7  requires  –  at  least  with  regard  to  the  mental  element  –  that  the  data  be  the  equivalent  of  a  public  or  private  document.
The acts covered  The  “input”  of  data1766 must  correspond  to  the  production  of  a  false  tangible  document.1767 The  term  “alteration”  refers  to  the  modification  of  existing  data.1768 The  Explanatory  Report  particularly  specifies   212   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     variations and partial changes.1769 The term “suppression” of computer data denotes an action that affects  the  availability  of  data.1770 In  the  Explanatory  Report,  the  drafters  specifically  refer  to  holding  back  or  concealment of data.1771 The act can for example be carried out by blocking certain information from a  database during the automatic creation of an electronic document.
The term “deletion” corresponds to  the  definition  of  the  term  in  Article 4  covering  acts  where  information  is  removed.1772 The  Explanatory  Report only refers to the removal of data from a data medium.1773 But the scope of the provision strongly  supports a broader definition of the term “deletion”.
Based on such a broad definition, the act can either  be carried out by removing an entire file or by partly erasing information in a file.1774    Mental element  Like all other offences defined by the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, Article 3 requires that  the offender is carrying out the offences intentionally.1775 The Convention on Cybercrime does not contain  a  definition  of  the  term  “intentionally”.
1777    Restrictions and reservations  Article 7 also offers the possibility of making a reservation in order to limit criminalization, by requiring  additional elements, such as the intent to defraud, before criminal liability arises.1778    Commonwealth Computer and Computer-related Crimes Model Law  The  2002  Commonwealth  Model  Law  does  not  contain  any  provision  criminalizing  computer-related  forgery.1779    Stanford Draft International Convention  The  informal1780 1999  Stanford  Draft  International  Convention  includes  a  provision  criminalizing  acts  related to falsified computer data.
Offenses under this Convention are committed if any person unlawfully and intentionally engages in any  of the following conduct without legally recognized authority, permission, or consent:  [...]     (b) creates, stores, alters, deletes, transmits, diverts, misroutes, manipulates, or interferes with data  in  a  cyber  system  for  the  purpose  and  with  the  effect  of  providing  false  information  in  order  to  cause substantial damage to persons or property;   [...]    The main difference in relation to Article 7 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime is the fact  that  Article 3 1b)  does  not  focus  on  the  mere  manipulation  of  data,  but  requires  interference  with  a  computer system.
Article 7 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime does not require such an  act; it is sufficient that the offender has acted with the intent that it be considered or acted upon for legal  purposes as if it were authentic.
Identity theft   6.2.17  Taking into consideration media coverage,1781 the results of recent surveys1782 and the numerous legal and  technical  publications1783 in  this  field,  it  seems  appropriate  to  refer  to  identity  theft  as  a  mass  phenomenon.1784 Despite the global aspects of the phenomenon, not all countries have yet implemented      213   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     provisions  in  their  national  criminal  law  system  that  criminalize  all  acts  related  to  identity  theft.
1786  One of the problems with comparing the existing legal instruments in the fight against identity theft is the  fact that they differ dramatically.1787 The only consistent element of existing approaches is the fact that  the condemned behaviour relates to one or more of the following phases:1788    •  Phase 1: Act of obtaining identity-related information.
•  Phase 2: Act of possessing or transferring the identity-related information.
•  Phase 3: Act of using the identity-related information for criminal purposes.
Based on this observation, there are in general two systematic approaches to criminalize identity theft:    •  The  creation  of  a  single  provision  that  criminalizes  the  act  of  obtaining,  possessing  and  using   identity-related information (for criminal purposes).
•  The individual criminalization of typical acts related to obtaining identity-related information (like  illegal access, the production and dissemination of malicious software, computer-related forgery,  data espionage and data interference) as well as acts related to the possession and use of such  information (like computer-related fraud).
Fraud and related activity in connection with identification documents, authentication features,  and information       (a) Whoever, in a circumstance described in subsection (c) of this section –    (1) knowingly and without lawful authority produces an identification document, authentication  feature, or a false identification document;  (2)  knowingly  transfers  an  identification  document,  authentication  feature,  or  a  false  identification document knowing that such document or feature was stolen or produced without  lawful authority;  (3)  knowingly  possesses  with  intent  to  use  unlawfully  or  transfer  unlawfully  five  or  more  identification documents (other  than  those  issued  lawfully  for  the  use  of  the  possessor),  authentication  features,  or  false  identification documents;  (4) knowingly possesses an identification document (other than one issued lawfully for the use of  the possessor), authentication feature, or a false identification document, with the intent such  document or feature be used to defraud the United States;  (5)  knowingly  produces,  implement  or  authentication  feature  with  the  intent  such  document-making  implement  or  authentication  feature will be used in the production of a false identification document or another document- making implement or authentication feature which will be so used;  (6) knowingly possesses an identification document or authentication feature that is or appears  to be an identification document or authentication feature of the United States which is stolen  or  produced  without  lawful  authority  knowing  that  such  document  or  feature  was  stolen  or  produced without such authority;   transfers,  or  possesses  a  document-making                     214   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response                (7) knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of  another person with the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, or in connection with, any unlawful  activity  that  constitutes  a  violation  of  Federal  law,  or  that  constitutes  a  felony  under  any  applicable State or local law; or  (8)  knowingly  traffics  in  false  or  actual  authentication  features  for  use  in  false  identification  documents, document-making implements, or means of identification;   shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) of this section.
This includes, especially,  the  possession  of  identity-related  information  with  the  intention  to  use  it  later  in  one  of  the  classic  offences  related  to  identity  theft.1792 The  possession  of  identity-related  data  without  the  intent  to  use  them is not covered.1793   Phase 3  By criminalizing the “use” with the intent to commit an offence, the provisions cover the acts related to  phase 3.
Another example is section 14 of the Cybercrime legislative text that was developed by the beneficiary  states within the HIPCAR initiative.1794     Identity-related Crimes   14.
Only the first  phase, in which the offender obtains the identity-related information, is not covered.
This act  is  especially  relevant  to  cover  the  sale  (and  related  transfer)  of  identity-related  information.
1795  “Possession”  is  the  control  a  person  intentionally  exercises  over  identity-related  information.
“Use”  covers a wide range of practices, such as submitting such information for purchase online.
With regard to  the mental element, the provision requires that the offender acts intentionally with regard to all objective  elements and in addition has specific intent to undertake the activity to commit, aid or abet any unlawful  activity that goes beyond the transfer, possession or use of identity-related information.
Example of a multiple-provision approach  The  main  difference  between  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  and  single-provision  approaches (like for example the United States approach) is the fact that the Convention on Cybercrime  does not define a separate cyberoffence of the unlawful use of identity-related information.1796 Similar to  the situation with regard to the criminalization of obtaining identity-related information, the Convention  on Cybercrime does not cover all possible acts related to the unlawful use of personal information.
These are especially:    •  Illegal access (Article 2)1798  •  Illegal interception (Article 3)1799  •  Data interference (Article 4) 1800   Taking into consideration the various ways in which an offender can access the data, it must be pointed  out that not all possible acts in phase 1 are covered.
Phase 2  Acts  that  take  place  between  obtaining  information  and  using  it  for  criminal  purposes  can  hardly  be  covered  by  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime.
It  is  especially  not  possible  to  prevent  a  growing black market for identity-related information by criminalizing the sale of such information based  on the provisions provided by the Convention on Cybercrime.
Some  of these offences can be committed by the perpetrator using identity-related information.
Other  offences  that  can  be  carried  out  using  identity-related  information obtained previously that are not mentioned in the Convention on Cybercrime are not covered  by the legal framework.
It is especially not possible to prosecute the use of identity-related information  with the intention to conceal identity.
6.2.18  Computer-related fraud  Fraud  is  a  popular  crime  in  cyberspace.1803 It  is  also  a  common  problem  beyond  the  Internet,  so  most  national  laws  contain  provisions  criminalizing  fraud  offences.1804 However,  the  application  of  existing  provisions to Internet-related cases can be difficult, where traditional national criminal law provisions are  based  on  the  falsity  of  a  person.1805 In  many  cases  of  fraud  committed  over  the  Internet,  it  is  in  fact  a   216   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     computer  system  that  responds  to  an  act  of  the  offender.
If  traditional  criminal  provisions  addressing  fraud do not cover computer systems, an update of the national law is necessary.1806    Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime  The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  seeks  to  criminalize  any  undue  manipulation  in  the  course  of  data  processing with the intention to effect an illegal transfer of property, by providing an article on computer- related fraud:1807    The provision    Article 8 – Computer-related fraud  Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal  offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right, the causing of a loss of  property to another person by:      with  fraudulent  or  dishonest  intent  of  procuring,  without  right,  an  economic  benefit  for  oneself  or  for  another person.
a. any input, alteration, deletion or suppression of computer data,  b. any interference with the functioning of a computer system,    The acts covered  Article  8  a)  contains  a  list of  the  most relevant  acts of  computer-related  fraud.1808 “Input”  of  computer  data  covers  all  kind  of  input  manipulation  such  as  feeding  incorrect  data  into  the  computer  as  well  as  computer  software  manipulations  and  other  acts  of  interference  in  the  course  of  data  processing.1809  “Alteration”  refers  to  the  modification  of  existing  data.1810 The  term  “suppression”  of  computer  data  denotes an action that affects the availability of data.1811 “Deletion” corresponds to the definition of the  term in Article 4 covering acts where information is removed.1812   In  addition  to  the  list  of  acts,  Article 8,  sub-paragraph  b)  contains  the  general  clause  that  criminalizes  fraud-related “interference with the functioning of a computer system”.
The Convention on  Cybercrime  follows  a  similar  concept  and  limits  criminalization  to  those  acts  where  the  manipulations  produce direct economic or possessory loss of another person’s property including money, tangibles and  intangibles with an economic value.1815    Mental element  As for the other offences listed, Article 8 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime requires that  the offender has acted intentionally.
In  addition,  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  requires  that  the  offender  has  acted  with  a  fraudulent  or  dishonest intent to gain economic or other benefit for self or other.1816 As examples of acts excluded from  criminal  liability  due  to  lack  of  specific  intent,  the  Explanatory  Report  mentions  commercial  practices  arising from market competition that may cause economic harm to one person and benefit to another,  but that are not carried out with fraudulent or dishonest intent.1817      217   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Without right  Computer-related fraud can only be prosecuted under Article 8 of the Convention on Cybercrime if it is  carried out “without right”.
1818 This includes the requirement that the economic benefit must be obtained  without right.
The drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime pointed out that acts carried out pursuant to  a valid contract between the affected persons are not considered to be without right.1819    Commonwealth Computer and Computer-related Crimes Model Law  The  2002  Commonwealth  Model  Law  does  not  contain  a  provision  criminalizing  computer-related  fraud.1820    Stanford Draft International Convention  The informal1821 1999 Stanford Draft International Convention does not contain a provision criminalizing  computer-related fraud.
With the switch to digital  sources, quality is preserved and consistent quality copies have become possible.1823   The  entertainment  implementing  technical  measures  (digital  rights  management  or  DRM)  to  prevent  reproduction1824,  but  until  now  these  measures  have  typically  been  circumvented  shortly  after  their  introduction.1825 Various  software  tools  are  available  over  the  Internet  that enable users to copy music CDs and movie DVDs protected by DRM-systems.
In addition, the Internet  offers  unlimited  distribution  opportunities.
As  a  result,  the  infringement  of  intellectual  property  rights  (especially of copyright) is a widely committed offence over the Internet.1826    industry  has  responded  by   Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime  The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  includes  a  provision  covering  these  copyright  offences  that  seeks  to  harmonize  the  various  regulations  in  national  laws.
Article 10 – Offences related to infringements of copyright and related rights  (1) Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal  offences  under  its  domestic  law  the  infringement  of  copyright,  as  defined  under  the  law  of  that  Party,  pursuant  to  the  obligations  it  has  undertaken  under  the  Paris  Act  of  24  July  1971  revising  the  Bern  Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of  Intellectual  Property  Rights  and  the  WIPO  Copyright  Treaty,  with  the  exception  of  any  moral  rights  conferred  by  such  conventions,  where  such  acts  are  committed  wilfully,  on  a  commercial  scale  and  by  means of a computer system.
(2) Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal  offences under its domestic law the infringement of related rights, as defined under the law of that Party,  pursuant  to  the  obligations  it  has  undertaken  under  the  International  Convention  for  the  Protection  of  Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations (Rome Convention), the Agreement  on  Trade-Related  Aspects  of  Intellectual  Property  Rights  and  the  WIPO  Performances  and  Phonograms  Treaty,  with  the  exception  of  any  moral  rights  conferred  by  such  conventions,  where  such  acts  are  committed wilfully, on a commercial scale and by means of a computer system.
218   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     (3) A Party may reserve the right not to impose criminal liability under paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article in  limited circumstances, provided that other effective remedies are available and that such reservation does  not derogate from the Party’s international obligations set forth in the international instruments referred  to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article.
The  infringement  of  copyrights  is  criminalized  in  some  countries1827 and  addressed  by  a  number  of  international treaties.1828 The Convention on Cybercrime aims to provide fundamental principles regarding  the  criminalization  of  copyright  violations  in  order  to  harmonize  existing  national  legislation.
Patent  or  trademark-related violations are not covered by the provision.1829    Reference to international agreements  Unlike  other  legal  frameworks,  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  does  not  explicitly  name  the  acts  to  be  criminalized, but refers to a number of international agreements.1830 This is one of the aspects which has  been criticized with regard to Article 10.
Apart from the fact that it makes it more difficult to discover the  extent  of  criminalization  and  that  the  agreements  might  subsequently  be  changed,  the  question  was  raised  whether  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  obliges  the  signatory  states  to  sign  the  international  agreements mentioned in Article 10.
The drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime pointed out that no  such obligation shall be introduced by the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.1831 Those states  that have not signed the mentioned international agreements are therefore neither obliged to sign the  agreements nor forced to criminalize acts related to agreements they have not signed.
The term “wilfully” corresponds  to “intentionally” used in the other substantive law provisions of the Convention on Cybercrime and takes  account of the terminology used in Article 61 of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  (TRIPS) Agreement1833, which governs the obligation to criminalize copyright violations.1834   Commercial scale  The  limitation  to  acts  that  are  committed  on  a  commercial  scale  also  takes  account  of  the  TRIPS  Agreement, which requires criminal sanctions only for “piracy on a commercial scale”.
The Convention on Cybercrime seeks to set minimum standards for Internet-related offences.
Thus,  parties  can  go  beyond  the  threshold  of  “commercial  scale”  in  the  criminalization  of  copyright  violations.1835    Without right  In  general  the  substantive  criminal  law  provisions  defined  by  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  require  that  the  act  is  carried  out  “without  right”.1836 The  drafters  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime pointed out that the term “infringement” already implies that the act was committed without  authorization.1837    Restrictions and reservations  Paragraph 3 enables signatories to make a reservation, as long as other effective remedies are available  and the reservation does not derogate from the parties’ international obligations.
Stanford Draft International Convention  The  informal1838 1999  Stanford  Draft  International  Convention  (“Stanford  Draft”)  does  not  include  a  provision  criminalizing  copyright  violations.
The  drafters  of  Stanford  Draft  pointed  out  that  copyright      219   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     crimes were not included because this may have proven difficult.1839 Instead, they referred directly to the  existing international agreements.1840    6.2.20  Terrorist use of the Internet  As pointed out above, the term “terrorist use of the Internet” is used to describe a set of activities that  range from spreading of propaganda to targeted attacks.
Systematic approaches   investigation   Use of existing cybercrime legislation  The first approach is the use of existing cybercrime legislation (developed to cover non-terrorist related  acts)  to  criminalize  terrorist  use  of  the  Internet.
First,  substantive  criminal  law  provisions  that  were  implemented  to  cover  non-terrorist  related acts such as system interference1841 might be applicable in terrorist-related cases, but very often  the range for sentencing will differ from specific terrorism legislation.
This could influence the ability to  use  sophisticated  instruments  that  are  restricted  to  terrorist  or  organized  crime  investigation.
Secondly,  the  application  of  cybercrime-specific  investigation  instruments  in  cases  of  terrorist use of the Internet faces fewer challenges, insofar as most countries do not limit the application  of  sophisticated  investigation  instruments  to  traditional  cybercrime  offences,  but  include  any  offence  involving  computer  data.
Finally,  regional  legal  instruments  developed  to  address  the  challenge  of  cybercrime  but  not  specifically  terrorist  use  of  the  Internet  often  contain  exemptions  for  international  cooperation with regard to political offences.
of the Council of  Europe Convention on Cybercrime.1842     Article  27  –  Procedures  pertaining  to  mutual  assistance  requests  in  the  absence  of  applicable  international agreements  [...]  4.
The requested Party may, in addition to the grounds for refusal established in Article 25, paragraph 4,  refuse assistance if:     a  the  request  concerns  an  offence  which  the  requested  Party  considers  a  political  offence  or  an  offence connected with a political offence, or  b it considers that execution of the request is likely to prejudice its sovereignty, security, ordre public  or other essential interests.
[...]      220   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Use of existing anti-terrorism legislation  The second approach is the use of existing terrorism legislation to criminalize and prosecute terrorist use  of the Internet.
Each Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish public provocation to commit a  terrorist offence, as defined in paragraph 1, when committed unlawfully and intentionally, as a criminal  offence under its domestic law.
For  the  purposes  of  this  Convention,  recruitment  for  terrorism  means  to  solicit  another  person  to  commit or participate in the commission of a terrorist offence, or to join an association or group, for the  purpose  of  contributing  to  the  commission  of  one  or  more  terrorist  offences  by  the  association  or  the  group.
Each Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish recruitment for terrorism, as  defined  in  paragraph  1,  when  committed  unlawfully  and  intentionally,  as  a  criminal  offence  under  its  domestic law.
Especially  with  regard  to the  investigation  of  Internet-related offences  specific  procedural  instruments  are  often  required.
Identifying  an  offender  who  has  incited  terrorism  using websites requires sophisticated instruments such as the expedited preservation of traffic data.
Specific legislation  The third approach is the development of specific legislation addressing terrorist use of the Internet.
Examples of specific legislation  As pointed out above, the term “terrorist use of the Internet” is used to describe a set of activities that  range from spreading of propaganda to targeted attacks.
Computer-related attacks  One approach for a provision that specifically addresses terrorism-related computer attacks is Section 66F  of the Indian Information Technology Act 2000, amended in 2008:     66F  Punishment  for  cyber  terrorism  –  Information  Technology  Act,  2000.
[As  Amended  by  Information  technology (Amendment) Act 2008]  (1) Whoever,-     (A) with intent to threaten the unity, integrity, security or sovereignty of India or to strike terror in  the people or any section of the people by –            (i) denying or cause the denial of access to any person authorized to access computer resource;  or  (ii) attempting to penetrate or access a computer resource without authorisation or exceeding  authorized access; or  (iii) introducing or causing to introduce any Computer Contaminant.
221   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response           and by means of such conduct causes or is likely to cause death or injuries to persons or damage  to  or  destruction  of  property  or  disrupts  or  knowing  that  it  is  likely  to  cause  damage  or  disruption of supplies or services essential to the life of the community or adversely affect the  critical information infrastructure specified under section 70, or   (B) knowingly or intentionally penetrates or accesses a computer resource without authorisation or  exceeding authorized access, and by means of such conduct obtains access to information, data or  computer database that is restricted for reasons of the security of the State or foreign relations; or  any  restricted  information,  data  or  computer  database,  with  reasons  to  believe  that  such  information, data or computer database so obtained may be used to cause or likely to cause injury  to the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations  with  foreign  States,  public  order,  decency  or  morality,  or  in  relation  to  contempt  of  court,  defamation  or  incitement  to  an  offence,  or  to  the  advantage  of  any  foreign  nation,  group  of  individuals or otherwise, commits the offence of cyber terrorism.
(2) Whoever commits or conspires to commit cyber terrorism shall be punishable with imprisonment which  may extend to imprisonment for life’.
Section 66F of the Indian Information Technology  Act does not only require that the offender is acting  with terrorism-related intent (“intent to threaten the unity, integrity, security or sovereignty of India or to  strike terror in the people or any section of the people”) but also that the offence leads to severe damage  such as death, injury or the disruption of services affecting critical information infrastructure.
One example of such a technology-neutral approach is Article 10 of the  Russian  Federal  Law  149-FZ  of  27.07.2006  on  Information,  Information  Technologies  and  Protection  of  Information.
Spreading of Information or Providing of Information  [...]  6.
It  is  forbidden  to  spread  information  aimed  at  war  propaganda,  national,  racial  or  religious  discrimination  and  hostility,  as  well  other  information  whose  spreading  is  liable  to  criminal  or  administrative responsibility.
This provision does not specifically address the distribution of illegal content through computer networks  or making content available on such networks, but was drafted so as to be technology neutral.
Each  Member  State  shall  take  the  necessary  measures  to  ensure  that  offences  linked  to  terrorist  activities include the following intentional acts:               (a) public provocation to commit a terrorist offence;  (b) recruitment for terrorism;  (c) training for terrorism;  (d) aggravated theft with a view to committing one of the offences listed in Article 1(1);  (e) extortion with a view to the perpetration of one of the offences listed in Article 1(1);  (f) drawing up false administrative documents with a view to committing one of the offences listed  in Article 1(1)(a) to (h) and Article 2(2)(b).
For an act as set out in paragraph 2 to be punishable, it shall not be necessary that a terrorist offence be  actually committed.’    The drafters emphasize in the introduction that the existing legal framework criminalizes aiding, abetting  and  inciting  terrorism  but  does  not  criminalize  the  dissemination  of  terrorist  expertise  through  the  Internet.
In this context, the drafters pointed out that “the Internet is used to inspire and mobilise local  terrorist networks and individuals in Europe and also serves as a source of information on terrorist means  and methods, thus functioning as a ‘virtual training camp’.”1847 Despite the fact that terrorist use of the  Internet was explicitly mentioned in the introduction, the provision provided is drafted in a technology- neutral  manner  and  consequently  covers  both  online  and  offline  acts  of  training  for  terrorism.1848 One  challenge related to the application of the provision in Internet-related cases is the difficulty of proving  that the offender acted knowing that the skills provided were intended to be used for this purpose.
As most weapons and explosives can be used to commit regular crimes as well as terrorist- related offences, the mere publication of this type of information does not prove that the publisher knew  how it would be used.
the fact that it appears on a website  operated  by  a  terrorist  organization)  will  need  to  be  considered.
This  can  present  challenges  if  the  information  published  is  outside  the  context  of  other  terrorism-related  content,  e.g.
One example of an Internet-specific approach is Article 5 of the Chinese Computer Information Network  and Internet Security, Protection and Management Regulations.
“Article  5:  No  unit  or  individual  may  use  the  Internet  to  create,  replicate,  retrieve,  or  transmit  the  following kinds of information:     (1) Inciting to resist or breaking the Constitution or laws or the implementation of administrative  regulations;  (2) Inciting to overthrow the government of the socialist system;  (3) Inciting division of the country, harming national unification;  (4) Inciting hatred or discrimination among nationalities or harming the unity of the nationalities;  (5) Making falsehoods or distorting the truth, spreading rumors, destroying the order of society;  (6) Promoting feudal superstitious, sexually suggestive material, gambling, violence, murder;  (7) Terrorism, or inciting others to criminal activity; openly insulting other people or distorting the  truth to slander people;  (8) Injuring the reputation of state organs;  (9) Other activities against the Constitution, law or administrative regulations.”                               223   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Cyberwarfare  Although threats related to cyberwarfare have been discussed for several decades, the debate on legal  response  has  only  just  started.
Even  more  than  cybercrime,  cyberwarfare  is  governed  by  international  law.
The Hague Conventions, the Geneva Conventions and the UN Charter are important instruments of  international law which contain regulations governing the laws of war.
While there is significant practice  of  applying  those  instruments  to  regular  armed  conflicts,  their  application  to  computer  and  network- based attacks runs into difficulties.
2 UN Charter  The Organization and its Members, in pursuit of the Purposes stated in Article 1, shall act in accordance  with the following Principles.
[...]  (4) All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the  territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the  Purposes of the United Nations.
Neither  the  UN  Charter  nor  any  related  international  instrument  clearly  defines the term “use of force”.
Even  though  the  importance  of  the  latter,  in  particular,  was  questioned  by  Security  Council  resolutions after the 9/11 attacks, both elements remain essential with regard to the ban on the use of  force.
Computer  technology  used  to  carry  out Internet- related attacks can hardly be called a traditional weapon, insofar as such weapons in general involve a  kinetic impact.1853 Nevertheless, the need to include chemical and biological weapons has already required  a  shift  from  an  action-oriented  definition  to  an  impact-oriented  approach.
Under  such  a  broader  approach, weapons could be defined as a tool to destroy life or property.1854   Even based upon a broad interpretation of this type, however, it is challenging to cover computer and  network-based  attacks  as  use  of  force  and  computer  technology  as  weapons,  since  the  impact  of  the  attacks  is  different.1855 Not  only  the  methods  used  but  also  the  effects  differ  in  relation  to  traditional  armed  conflicts.1856 Traditional  military  strategies  involving  the  use  of  weapons  focus  on  the  physical  termination of an enemy’s military capabilities.
If computer   224   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     and  network-based  attacks  have  such  a  physical  impact,  they  can  be  considered  to  be  similar  to  traditional weapons.1858    Conflict among states  As pointed out above, the second requirement for the application of Article 2 of the UN Charter is that the  use  of  force  is  undertaken  by  a  state  against  another  state.
There  are  serious  concerns  with  regard  to  proliferation,  as  non-state  actors  can  acquire  powerful  resources  that  might  even  go  beyond  those  controlled  by  states.1859 The  largest  botnets  contain  several  million  computer  systems.
The capabilities of non-state actors is highly relevant, since they primarily act  outside  the  international  legal  framework  which  binds  states.
The application of Article 2 of the UN Charter so far requires that a computer attack be traced  back  to  a  state.

Especially  due  to  increasing  hard-drive  capacities1860 and  the  falling  cost1861 of  the  storage  of  digital  documents  compared  to  the  storage  of  physical  documents,  the  number  of  digital  documents  is  growing.1862 Today, a significant amount of data is stored in digital form only.1863 In addition, computer and  network  technologies  have  become  part  of  everyday  life  in  developed  countries  and  increasingly  in  developing countries.
As a consequence, electronic documents such as text documents, digital videos and  digital pictures1864 are playing a role in cybercrime investigations and related court proceedings.1865   Yet  the  impact  of  digitization  and  the  importance  of  digital  evidence  is  stretching  beyond  cybercrime  investigation:  even  when  committing  traditional  crimes,  offenders  may  leave  digital  traces,  such  as  information on the location of their cellphone1866 or suspicious search-engine requests.1867 The ability to  exploit  specific  data-related  investigation  tools  and  present  digital  evidence  in  court  is  therefore  considered essential for both cybercrime-related and traditional crime investigation.1868   Dealing with “digital evidence” presents a number of challenges,1869 but also opens up new possibilities for  investigation and for the work of forensic experts and courts.
Already at the first stage – the collection of  evidence – the need to be able to handle digital evidence has changed the work of investigators.
In these cases, the  ability  to  successfully  identify  and  prosecute  an  offender  may  be  based  on  the  correct  collection  and  evaluation of digital evidence.1870 Beyond the collection of evidence, however, digitization also influences  the  way  law-enforcement  agencies  and  courts  deal  with  evidence.1871 While  traditional  documents  are  introduced by handing out the original document in court, digital evidence in some cases requires specific  procedures that do not allow conversion into traditional evidence, e.g.
by presenting a printout of files  and other discovered data.1872   The  following  chapter  provides  an  overview  of  practical  and  legal  aspects  of  digital  evidence  and  cybercrime investigations.
available   2008,   226   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response   Definition of digital evidence     6.3.1  The digitization and emerging use of ICT has a huge impact on procedures for the collection of evidence  and its use in court.1873 As a consequence of the development, digital evidence has been introduced as a  new source of evidence.1874 There is no single definition  of electronic  or digital evidence.1875 The United  Kingdom (UK) Police and Criminal Evidence Code defines digital evidence as “all information contained in  a  computer”.1876 A  broader  approach  defines  digital  evidence  as  any  data  stored  or  transmitted  using  computer technology that supports the theory of how an offence occurred.1877    Importance of digital evidence in cybercrime investigations   6.3.2  Digital  evidence  plays  an  important  role  in  various  phases  of  cybercrime  investigations.
It  is  in  general  possible  to  divide  between  two  major  phases1878:  the  investigation  phase  (identification  of  relevant  evidence1879,  collection  and  preservation  of  evidence1880,  analysis  of  computer  technology  and  digital  evidence) and the presentation and use of evidence in court proceedings.
The term  “computer forensics” describes the systematic analysis of IT equipment with the purpose of searching for  digital  evidence.1881 The  constant  growth  in  the  amount  of  data  stored  in  digital  format  highlights  the  logistic  challenges  of  investigations.1882 Approaches  to  automated  forensic  procedures  by,  for  example,  using  hash-value  based  searches  for  known  child-pornography  images 1883 or  keyword  searches 1884  therefore  play  an  important  role  in  addition  to  manual  investigations.1885 Computer  forensics  include  investigations  such  as  analysing  the  hardware  and  software  used  by  a  suspect,1886 recovering  deleted  files,1887 decrypting files1888 or identifying Internet users by analysing traffic data.1889  The second phase relates to the presentation of digital evidence in court.
It is closely linked to specific  procedures that are required because digital information can only be made visible when printed out or  displayed with the use of computer technology.
Due to the increasing integration of computer  technology in people’s everyday life, digital evidence is becoming an important source of evidence even in  traditional  investigation.
One  example  is  a  murder  trial  in  the  US,  in  which  records  of  search-engine  requests stored on the suspect’s computer were used to prove that, prior to the murder, the suspect was  intensively using search engines to find information on undetectable poisons.
6.3.4  New opportunities for investigation  Depending on the ICT and Internet services used by a suspect, a wide variety of digital traces are left.1890 If,  for example, a suspect uses search engines to find online child pornography his search request, then IP- addresses  and  in  some  case  even  additional  identity-related  information  (such  as  Google  ID)  are  recorded.1891 Digital  cameras  used  to  produce  child-pornography  images  in  some  cases  include  geo- information in the file that enables investigators to identify the location where the picture was taken if  such images are seized on a server.1892 Suspects who download illegal content from file-sharing networks  can  in  some  cases  be  traced  by  the  unique  ID  that  is  generated  in  the  installation  of  the  file-sharing  software.1893 And  the  falsification  of  an  electronic  document  might  generate  metadata  that  enable  the  original author of the document to prove the manipulation.1894  Another  aspect  that  is  frequently  quoted  as  an  advantage  is  the  neutrality  and  reliability  of  digital  evidence.1895 In  comparison  with  some  other  categories  of  evidence  such  as  witness  statements,  digital  evidence is certainly less vulnerable to influence that can affect the preservation of evidence.1896    Challenges   6.3.5  In  the  early  days  of  computer  technology,  the  ability  of  law  enforcement  to  carry  out  investigations  involving digital data was limited by a lack of computer forensic equipment and expertise.1897 The growing      227   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     importance of digital evidence has spawned an increasing number of computer forensic laboratories.
Some  of  the  general  principles1898, such as the requirement that the evidence be authentic, complete, reliable1899 and accurate  and that the process of obtaining the evidence take place in line with the legal requirements, still hold  good.1900 Alongside  the  similarities,  however,  there  are a number  of  aspects  that  make  digital  evidence  unique  and  therefore  require  special  attention  when  dealing  with  digital  evidence  in  criminal  investigations.
Need for scientific research and training  Digital evidence is a relatively new category of evidence and the field is developing fast.
And despite the  very limited time-frame available for basic scientific research, the procedures for searching, seizing and  analysing  digital  evidence  now  already  need  to  be  based  on  scientifically  reliable  principles  and  procedures.1901 Despite  intensive  research  already  undertaken  there  are  various  areas  that  require  the  attention  of  scientists.
Given  that developments might raise new challenges for forensic examination,1904 it is necessary to be constantly  training experts.
Need for binding legal standards  Although  computer  and  network  technologies  are  used  globally  and  the  challenges  related  to  the  admissibility of digital evidence in court are – despite the different legal systems – similar, binding legal  standards dealing with digital evidence have not been widely implemented.1905 Only some countries have  so far started to update their relevant legislation to enable courts to deal directly with digital evidence.1906  As  with  regard  to  substantive  criminal  law  and  procedural  instruments  in  the  fight  against  cybercrime,  here too there is a lack of global harmonization of legal standards, in the area of digital evidence.
Quantitative aspects  As pointed out above, the low costs1907 compared to the storage of physical documents are giving rise to  an  increasing  number  of  digital  documents.1908 Despite  the  availability  of  tools  to  automate  search  processes1909,  identifying  the  relevant  digital  evidence  on  a  storage  device  that  can  carry  millions  of  documents is a logistical challenge for investigators.1910   Reliance on expert statements  Analysing and evaluating digital evidence requires special skills and technical understanding which is not  necessarily  covered  in  the  education  received  by  judges,  prosecutors  and  lawyers.
To avoid a negative  influence, courts are encouraged to question the reliability of evidence and require qualification of the  associated uncertainty.1912    Fragile nature of digital evidence  Digital  data  are  highly  fragile  and  can  so  easily  be  deleted1913 or  modified1914 that  experts  consider  it  alarming.1915 Like  other  categories  of  evidence,  digital  data  present  some  degree  of  uncertainty.1916 To  avoid a negative impact on reliability, the collection of digital evidence is often subject to certain technical  requirements.
The shutdown of a computer system will, for example, result in a loss of all memory stored  in the RAM system memory1917 unless special technical measures to prevent this process are applied.1918 In  cases  where  data  are  stored  in  a  temporary  memory,  the  technique  of  collecting  the  evidence  can  be   228   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     different from the process of collecting traditional digital evidence.1919 Such a sophisticated approach can  be  necessary,  for  example,  if  the  suspect  is  using  encryption  technology  and  the  investigators  want  to  examine  whether  information  stored  in  the  RAM  memory  can  help  them  to  access  encrypted  information.1920   Modifications can be made both intentionally by the offender or accidentally by the investigators.
A loss  or modification of data can in the worst scenario lead to wrongful conviction.1921   As a consequence of its fragility, one of the most fundamental principles of computer forensics is the need  to maintain the integrity of digital evidence.1922 Integrity can in this context be defined as the property  whereby digital data have not been altered in an unauthorized manner since the time they were created,  transmitted or stored by an authorized source.1923 Protecting integrity is necessary to ensure reliability and  accuracy.1924 Handling  evidence  of  this  kind  requires  standards  and  procedures  in  order  to  maintain  an  effective quality system.
This includes general aspects such as case records, the use of widely accepted  technology  and  procedures,  and  operation  by  qualified  experts  only1925,  as  well  as  the  application  of  specific methods such as checksum, hash algorithm and digital signatures.1926 The required methods are  costly and cannot completely exclude the risks of alteration.1927   Limited amount of data recorded  For many Internet users, it is surprising how much information about their activities is stored.
The average  user  might  not  be  aware  that  when  accessing  the  Internet  or  carrying  out  specific  actions  like  using  a  search engine1928 he/she is leaving traces.
Nonetheless, not all digital information generated during the use of computer technology is  stored.
Many actions and much information such as clicks and keystrokes are not retained unless special  surveillance software is installed.1929    Layer of abstraction  Even if a suspect’s activities create digital evidence, this evidence is separated in time from the events it  records and is therefore more of a historic record than a live observation.1930 In addition, the evidence is  not  necessarily  personalized.
If,  for  example,  a  suspect  is  using  a  public  Internet  café  to  access  child  pornography, the traces do not necessarily contain identity-related information that allows identification.
Unless the suspect at the same time downloads his e-mails or uses services that require a registration, in  which case a link is created.
But as this is not necessarily the case, experts point out that this leads to a  layer of abstraction that can introduce errors.1931    Requirements related to infrastructure  The  design  of  courtrooms  has  followed  similar  principles  for  decades  and  in  some  countries  even  centuries.
Leaving  aside  aspects  of  security  (e.g.
Changing technical environment  As pointed out above, technology is constantly changing.
Similar  developments  take  place  with  regard  to  the  hardware.1935 In  the  past,  data  were  stored  on  floppy  disks.
Today,  investigators  will  find  that  relevant  information  might  be  stored  on  MP3-players  or  in  watches  that  include  a  USB-storage  device.
The      229   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     challenges  are  not  limited  to  keeping  up  with  the  latest  trends  in  computer  technology.1936 Forensic  experts also need to maintain equipment to deal with discontinued technology, such as 5.25 inch floppy  disks.
In  addition  to  changes  in  hardware,  discontinued  software  needs  to  be  accessible:  files  from  discontinued software tools can often not be opened without using the original software.
The  availability  of  broadband access and remote storage servers has, for example, influenced the way information is stored.
While in the past investigators were able to focus on the suspect’s premises when searching for digital  evidence,  today  they  need  to  take  into  consideration  that  files  might  physically  be  stored  abroad  and  accessed remotely by the suspect when necessary.1937 The increasing use of cloud storage presents new  challenges for investigators.1938    Equivalences of digital evidence and traditional evidence   6.3.6  Research  undertaken  in  Europe  in  2005/2006  highlighted  various  areas  of  equivalence  of  digital  and  traditional evidence in the 16 countries analysed.1939 The most common equivalence is between electronic  documents and documents in paper form.
This is especially relevant because not all computer operations leave digital traces and not all  traces that are left can be linked to the suspect.1948 If public Internet terminals are used to download child  pornography, it might not be possible to link the download process to an identifiable person if that person  did not register1949 or leave any personal information; but the recording on a videosurveillance camera or  fingerprints  on  the  keyboard  could  be  useful,  if  available.
Information about the location of the suspect’s phone might allow law-enforcement  agencies to identify his location1950 and suspicious search-engine requests might lead to the location of a  missing victim.1951 With regard to crimes that include financial transactions (such as commercial exchange  of child pornography1952), investigations can also include records kept by financial organizations in order to  identify  the  offender.
Specific requirements relating to the collection   230   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     of digital evidence will be discussed further in the chapter below dealing with procedural law.
Summarizing those principles is a challenge, though, since not only  is  there  a  lack  of  binding  international  agreements,  but  there  are  also  substantial  differences  in  the  dogmatic approach to dealing with digital evidence.
While some countries give judges wide discretion in  admitting or rejecting digital evidence, others have started to develop a legal framework to address the  admissibility of evidence in court.1954    Legitimacy  One  of  the  most  fundamental  requirements  for  the  admissibility  of  both  traditional  categories  of  evidence1955 and digital evidence alike is the legitimacy of evidence.1956 This principle requires that digital  evidence has been collected, analysed, preserved and finally presented in court in accordance with the  appropriate  procedures  and  without  violating  the  fundamental  rights  of  the  suspect.1957 Both  the  requirements relating to the collection, analysis, preservation and finally presentation of the evidence in  court and the consequences of a violation of the suspect’s rights differ from country to country.
Principles  and rules that can possibly be violated range from fundamental rights of a suspect such as privacy1958 to  failure to respect procedural requirements.
Due to the often inadequate legislation, general principles of  evidence are frequently applied to digital evidence.1959   The requirements for the collection of digital evidence are mainly set by criminal procedural law.
In most  countries,  the  interception  of  content  data  for  example  requires  a  court  order  and  an  extension  of  a  search to remote storage devices requires that they be located in the same country.
The requirements for preservation of evidence are less  often defined by law.1960 However, the fundamental principle of the necessity to protect the integrity of  digital evidence is certainly a guideline.1961 Investigators need to make sure that evidence is not altered in  any unauthorized manner from the time it was created, transmitted or stored by an authorized source.1962  Protecting  integrity  is  necessary  in  order  to  ensure  reliability  and  accuracy  and  to  comply  with  the  principle of legitimacy.1963 The procedures for the presentation of evidence in court are rarely defined by  law.
As stated above, not only the requirements but also the consequences of a violation of procedures and  the rights of the suspect vary significantly.1964 While some countries consider evidence to be inadmissible  only if collected in a manner which seriously violates the suspect’s rights (and not, for example, if only  formal requirements were violated) and do not exclude such evidence, other countries – especially those  applying the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine – apply other standards for admissibility.1965   Best evidence rule  For  common-law  jurisdictions,  the  best  evidence  rule  is  of  great  importance.
However, the old rule has effectively been discarded by the courts, and any surviving remnants of this rule  are  further  limited  in  criminal  proceedings  by  legislation  (which  now  generally  permits  the  use  of  authenticated copies).1969   The logic of requiring the production of an original document where it is available rather than relying on  possibly unsatisfactory copies, or the recollections of witnesses, is clear1970, although modern techniques  make objections to the first alternative weak.
But  courts  have  started  to  open  the  rule  to  new  developments  by  accepting  an  electronic copy as well as the original document.1974 The best evidence rule in this broader interpretation  does not require a written or witness testimony in every instance, but that the best obtainable evidence  of its contents be used.1975 Moreover, the best evidence rule has been enshrined in most of the statutory  regimes established in the common law region.1976    Rule against hearsay  The  rule  against  hearsay  is  another  principle  that  is  particularly  relevant  for  common  law  countries.1977  Hearsay evidence is evidence given by a witness in court of a statement made by some other person out  of  court,  when  such  evidence  is  tendered  to  prove  the  truth  of  the  statement.1978 Under  common  law,  hearsay evidence was generally inadmissible; but in civil proceedings this rule was abolished in the UK by  the Civil Evidence Act 1995, which provides for the admissibility of hearsay evidence subject to statutory  safeguards, and preserves a number of common law exceptions to the rule against hearsay.1979  According to the common law rule against hearsay, an assertion other than one made by a person while  giving oral evidence in the proceedings and tendered as evidence of the facts asserted is inadmissible1980.
An out-of-court statement, for the purposes of the rule, means any statement other than one made by a  witness in the course of giving his evidence, and could include, for example, a statement made in previous  legal  proceedings.
The rules governing the admissibility of hearsay evidence now apply if (and only if) the purpose,  or one of the purposes, of the person making the statement appears to the court to have been to cause  another person to believe the matter, or to cause another person to act or a machine to operate on the  basis that the matter is as stated.1984   Having regard to the fact that data collected during an investigation (such as log-files) intend to prove the  truth of the matter asserted in the digital evidence itself, strict application of the rule is problematical in  an age where very often digital evidence is the most relevant category of evidence in court proceedings,  and some common law countries have started to implement statutory exceptions to the hearsay rule.1985  Evidence  produced  by  computers,  cameras  or  other  machines  without  incorporating  any  human  statement cannot be hearsay.1986 Under common law, it used to be held that visual images, even when  produced by human hands, were not “statements” of any facts they purported to represent and therefore  could not be hearsay.
Information  generated  mechanically  without  human  intervention  would  on  this  basis  not  be  considered as potentially hearsay evidence1988 unless the process of creating the software is used as an  argument to apply the rule even in those cases.1989    232   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Relevance/effectiveness  Relevance and effectiveness are other common requirements for the admissibility of digital evidence.1990  Taking into account the amount of data that is stored even on a private computer, only a tiny proportion  of  which  might  be  relevant  for  the  case,  one  can  see  the  practical  importance  of  this  criterion  in  cybercrime investigation.
Unlike  with  traditional  evidence,  where  during  the  collection  process  irrelevant  pieces  of  evidence  can  simply  be  ignored,  the  selection  process  is  more  challenging  when  it  comes  to  digital  evidence1991,  since  at  the  time  when  the  computer  hardware  is  seized  it  is  almost  impossible  to  determine whether the storage devices concerned contain relevant information or not.
Transparency  Unlike traditional search and seizure operations, which are carried out openly and therefore guarantee  that the suspect is aware that an investigation is being carried out, sophisticated investigation tools such  as  the  real-time  interception  of  communications  do  not  require  such  disclosure.
Despite  the  technical  ability, not all countries allow law-enforcement agencies to carry out covert operations, or at least require  that the suspect be informed afterwards.
Only a  few  countries  have  so  far  addressed  specific  aspects  of  digital  evidence  and,  in  addition,  international  binding standards are lacking.1992    Commonwealth Electronic Evidence Model Law (2002)  In 2000, the Law Ministers of Small Commonwealth Jurisdictions decided to establish a working group to  develop model legislation on electronic evidence.
The main comparative law analysis finding of the study  group was that, with regard to the admissibility of digital evidence, the reliability of the system by which  the  digital  evidence  was  created  is  more  important  than  the  document  itself.
(2)  In  any  legal  proceeding,  where  an  electronic  record  in  the  form  of  printout  has  been  manifestly  or  consistently  acted  on,  relied  upon,  or  used  as  the  record  of  the  information  recorded  or  stored  on  the  printout, the printout is the record for the purposes of the best evidence rule.
This is especially relevant in regard to the best evidence  rule, which is of great importance for common law countries.1998 The aim of the best evidence rule is to  minimize  the  risks  of  mistranscriptions,  testimonial  misstatements  of  what  the  document  contains  and  undetected  tampering.1999 Admissibility  of  evidence  requires  that  documentary  evidence  be  the  best  evidence  available  to  the  party.

The offender might have acted from country A, used an Internet service in  country B and the victim is based in country C. This is a challenge with regard to the application of criminal  law2002 and  leads  to  questions  about  which  of  the  countries  has  jurisdiction,  which country  should  take  forward  the  investigation  and  how  to  resolve  disputes.
While  this  case  looks  already  challenging  it  is  necessary to take into consideration that if the offence, for example, involves cloud computing services  even more jurisdictions may be triggered.2003  The term “jurisdiction” is used to describe various different legal issues.2004 Based upon principles of public  international law “jurisdiction” describes the authority of a sovereign state to regulate certain conduct.2005  It is therefore one aspect of national sovereignty.2006 However, in the context of cybercrime investigation  “jurisdiction” refers to the authority of a state to enforce its domestic law.2007 In general, law enforcement  will only be able to carry out an investigation if the country has jurisdiction.
Principle of territoriality / principle of objective territoriality   6.4.3  The most fundamental principle and most common basis of jurisdiction is the principle of territoriality.2008  It is applicable if an offence – regardless of the nationality of the offender or victim – is committed within  the  territory  of  a  sovereign  state.2009 The  fact  that  jurisdiction  in  general  only  makes  sense  if  it  can  be  enforced and enforcement of law requires control (that is in general limited to the territory) explains the  relevance  of  the  principle.
Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish jurisdiction  over any offence established in accordance with Articles 2 through 11 of this Convention, when the offence  is committed:           a. in its territory; or  b. on board a ship flying the flag of that Party; or  c. on board an aircraft registered under the laws of that Party; or  d. by one of its nationals, if the offence is punishable under criminal law where it was committed or  if the offence is committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of any State.
A  crime  was  certainly  committed  if  the  offender  and  the  victim  were  physically  present  in  the  country  while  the  offender  illegally  accessed  the  victim’s  computer  system.
But  was  the  offence  committed  within  the      235   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     territory of a state if the offender acted from abroad when accessing the computer system of the victim in  the country?
However, the International Court of Justices expressed in  the “Lotus” case that even in cases where countries apply jurisdiction only on the basis of territoriality,  extraterritorial  conduct  may  nevertheless  be  regarded  as  committed  in  the  territory  if  one  of  the  constituent  elements  of  the  offence  (especially  its  effect)  have  taken  place  in  the  country.2010 This  doctrine, that is also referred to as “principle of objective territoriality”2011 is highly relevant in cybercrime  cases.2012 But taking into account that a malicious software that was sent out by an offender might affect  computer  systems  in  various  countries  underlines  that  such  extensive  definition  of  territoriality  easily  leads  to  possible  conflicts  of  jurisdiction.2013 The  risk  of  potential  conflicts  increases  even  more  if  the  principle of territoriality is applied to cases where neither the offender nor victim are located within the  country  but  only  the  infrastructure  within  a  country  was  used  within  the  commission  of  a  crime  –  for  example  if  an  e-mail  with  illegal  content  was  sent  out  by  using  an e-mail  provider  in  one  country  or  a  website with illegal content is stored on the server of a hosting provider in the country.
Taking into account the availability of Internet access solutions for maritime  and air transportation,2015 raises questions related to the application of criminal law in cases where either  the offender, victim or affected computer systems is not located in the territory but outside the territorial  borders of country on board of a ship or aircraft.
Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish jurisdiction  over any offence established in accordance with Articles 2 through 11 of this Convention, when the offence  is committed:           a. in its territory; or  b. on board a ship flying the flag of that Party; or  c. on board an aircraft registered under the laws of that Party; or  d. by one of its nationals, if the offence is punishable under criminal law where it was committed or  if the offence is committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of any State.

Principle of universality    6.4.7  The universality principle established jurisdiction in relation to specific crimes that are in the interest of  the international community.2023 This principle is especially relevant with regard to serious crimes such as      237   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     crimes against humanity and war crimes.2024 However, various countries that recognise the principle have  developed  it  further.2025 As  a  consequence  the  principle  is  under  certain  circumstances  even  applicable  with regard to cybercrime.
Section 6  Offences committed abroad against internationally protected legal interests  German criminal law shall further apply, regardless of the law of the locality where they are committed, to  the following offences committed abroad:       1.
(repealed) ;  2. offences involving nuclear energy, explosives and radiation under section 307 and section 308(1)  to (4), section 309(2) and section 310;  3. attacks on air and maritime traffic (section 316c);  4. human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation, for the purpose of work exploitation and  assisting human trafficking (Sections 232 to 233a);  5. unlawful drug dealing;  6. distribution of pornography under sections 184a, 184b (1) to (3) and section 184c (1) to (3), also  in conjunction with section 184d, 1st sentence;             [...]   Based upon section 6 (6) Germany may exercise jurisdiction with regard to Internet websites that offer  child pornography for download even if the operator of the website is not located in Germany, the servers  are not based in Germany and no German Internet user accessed the website.

Slobogin,   available   Introduction   6.5.1  As explained in the sections above, the fight against cybercrime requires adequate substantive criminal  law provisions.2026 At least in civil law countries, law-enforcement agencies will not be able to investigate  crimes without those laws in place.
But the requirement of law-enforcement agencies in the fight against  cybercrime is not limited to substantive criminal law provisions.2027 In order to carry out the investigations  they  need  to  undertake  –  in  addition  to  training  and  equipment  –  procedural  instruments  that  enable  them to take the measures that are necessary to identify the offender and collect the evidence required  for  the  criminal  proceedings.2028 These  measures  can  be  the  same  ones  that  are  undertaken  in  other  investigations  not  related  to  cybercrime  –  but  having  regard  to  the  fact  that  the  offender  does  not  necessarily  need  to  be  present  at  or  even  close  to  the  crime  scene,  it  is  very  likely  that  cybercrime  investigations need to be carried out in a different way compared to traditional investigations.2029   The reason why different investigation techniques are necessary is not only due to the independence of  place  of  action  and  the  crime  scene.
It  is  in  most  cases  a  combination  of  a  number  of  the  above- mentioned challenges for law-enforcement agencies that make cybercrime investigations unique.2030 If the  offender is based in a different country2031, uses services that enable anonymous communication and, in  addition,  commits  the  crimes  by  using  different  public  Internet  terminals,  the  crime  can  hardly  be  investigated based on traditional instruments like search and seizure alone.
To avoid misunderstanding, it  is  important  to  point  out  that  cybercrime  investigations  require  classic  detective  work  as  well  as  the  application of traditional investigation instruments – but cybercrime investigations face challenges that  cannot be solved solely using traditional investigation instruments.2032   Some  countries  have  already  developed  new  instruments  to  enable  law-enforcement  agencies  to  investigate cybercrime, as well as traditional crimes that require the analysis of computer data.2033 As is  the  case  with  regard to the  substantive  criminal  law,  the  Council of  Europe  Convention  on Cybercrime  contains  a  set  of  provisions  that  reflect  wide  accepted  minimum  standards  regarding  procedural  instruments required for cybercrime investigations.2034 The following overview will therefore refer to the  instruments offered by this international convention and in addition highlight national approaches that go  beyond the regulations of the Convention on Cybercrime.
Computer and Internet investigations (Computer Forensics)   6.5.2  The  term  computer  forensics  is  used  to  describe  the  systematic  collection  of  data  and  analysis  of  computer technology with the purpose of searching for digital evidence.2035 Such analysis generally takes      239   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     place  after  the  crime  was  committed.2036 It  is  thus  a  major  part  of  computer  crime  and  cybercrime  investigation.
In  addition,  the  dependence  of  the  success  of  Internet  investigations  on  the  availability of forensic resources highlights the need for training in this area.
Only if the investigators are  either trained in computer forensics or have access to experts in the area can efficient investigation and  prosecution of cybercrime be conducted.
Definition  There  are  various  definitions  of  “computer  forensics”.2037 It  can  be  defined  as  “the  examination  of  IT  equipment  and  systems  in  order  to  obtain  information  for  criminal  or  civil  investigation”.2038 When  committing crimes, offenders leave traces.2039 This statement is valid in traditional investigations as well as  computer  investigations.
The  main  difference  between  a  traditional  investigation  and  a  cybercrime  investigation  is  that  a  cybercrime  investigation  generally  requires  specific  data-related  investigation  techniques  and  can  be  facilitated  by  specialized  software  tools.2040 In  addition  to  adequate  procedural  instruments, carrying  out  such  analysis  requires  that the  authorities  possess  the ability  to  manage  and  analyse  the  relevant  data.
Depending  on  the  offences  and  the  computer  technology  involved,  the  requirements  in  terms  of  procedural  investigation  tools  and  forensic  analysis  techniques  differ2041 and  present unique challenges.2042    is   in  general  possible  to  distinguish  between  two  major  phases: 2043  the   Phases of forensic investigations  investigation  phase  It  (identification  of  relevant  evidence,2044 collection  and  preservation  of  evidence,2045 analysis  of  computer  technology and digital evidence) and the presentation and use of evidence in court proceedings.
This  enables  investigators to limit the scope of the investigation to those parts of the computer infrastructure that are  relevant for the investigation and avoid inappropriate and large-scale seizure of computer hardware.2050  This  selection  process  is  relevant  as  various  types  of  storage  device  are  available  that  can  make  identification  of  the  storage  location  of  relevant  evidence  challenging.2051 This  is  especially  valid  if  the  suspect is not storing information locally but uses means of remote storage.
The availability of broadband  access and remote storage servers has influenced the way information is stored.
If the suspect is storing  information on a server that is located in another country, this simple act can make it more difficult to  seize evidence.
Forensic analysis can in this case be used to determine whether remote-storage services  were used.2052 Identification of relevant digital information is not confined to files themselves.
Databases  of  software  tools  that  are  made  available  by  operating  systems  to  quickly  identify  files  might  contain  relevant information, too.2053 Even system-generated temporary files might contain evidence for criminal  proceedings.2054   Another example of evidence identification is the involvement of forensic experts in determining the right  procedural instruments.
Forensic  experts  can  determine  whether  the  collection  of  traffic  data  is  sufficient  to  prove  the  committing of a crime, and thereby help investigators to strike the right balance between the need to   240   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     collect  effective  evidence  and  the  obligation  to  protect  the  rights  of  the  suspect  by  choosing  the  least  intensive  instrument  out  of  the  group  of  equally  effect  options.
Both  examples  show  that  the  role  of  forensic  investigators  is  not  restricted  to  the  technical  aspects  of  an  investigation,  but  includes  a  responsibility for protecting the suspect’s fundamental rights and thereby avoiding inadmissibility of the  evidence collected.2055    Collection and preservation of the evidence   Involvement  in  the  collection  of  digital  evidence  requires  complex  skills,  since  the  techniques  used  to  collect evidence that is stored on the hard drive of a home computer and those employed to intercept a  data-  transmission  process  are  significantly  different.
To  avoid interfering with the integrity of relevant digital evidence, a common instruction is to pull the plug,  as this stops any alteration of files.2056 However, such a disruption of  energy can activate encryption2057  and  thereby  hinder  access  to  stored  data.2058 First  responders,  who  undertake  the  first  steps  to  collect  digital  evidence,  bear  a  significant  responsibility  for  the  entire  investigation  process,  as  any  wrong  decision  can  have  a  major  impact  on  the  ability  to  preserve  relevant  evidence.2059 If  they  make  wrong  decisions on preservation, important traces can be lost.
Forensic experts need to ensure that all relevant evidence is identified.2060 This can be difficult if offenders  hide files in a storage device in order to prevent law-enforcement agencies from analysing the content of  the  file.
Forensic  investigations  can  identify  hidden  files  and  make  them  accessible.2061 Similar  recovery  processes are necessary if digital information has been deleted.2062 Files that are deleted by simply placing  them in a virtual trash bin does not necessarily render them unavailable to law-enforcement agencies, as  they may be recovered using special forensic software tools.2063 However, if offenders are using tools to  ensure  that  files  are  securely  deleted  by  overwriting  the  information,  recovery  is  in  general  not  possible.2064 The collection of evidence can also face challenges if criminals are trying to prevent access to  relevant  information  by  using  encryption  technology.
Such  technology  is  more  and  more  frequently  used.2065 Given that this prevents law-enforcement agencies from accessing and examining the encrypted  information,  the  use  of  encryption  technology  entails  significant  challenges  for  law-enforcement  agencies.2066 Forensic experts can try to decrypt encrypted files.2067 If this is not possible, they can support  law-enforcement agencies in developing strategies to gain access to encrypted files, for example by using  a keylogger.2068   Involvement  in  the  collection  of  evidence  includes  the  evaluation  and  implementation  of  new  instruments.
Where such a tool is available,  it can play a role in the development of a strategy to collect digital evidence.
Communication with service providers  Internet  service  providers  (ISPs)  play  an  important  role  in  many  cybercrime  investigations,  since  most  users are utilizing their services to access the Internet or store websites.
Obligations discussed range from the mandatory implementation of prevention technology to voluntary  support of investigations.2072 Forensic experts can also support an investigation by preparing requests that  are  submitted  to  service  providers 2073 and  assisting  the  investigators  in  producing  adequate  case  histories2074 which are necessary to prove the reliability of the collected evidence.
Cooperation between  law-enforcement  agencies  and  investigations  requires  the  application  of  certain  procedures.2075 The  Council  of  Europe  Guidelines  for  the  Cooperation  of  Law  Enforcement  and  ISPs2076  contain a set of fundamental procedures, including issues such as providing explanations and assistance  regarding investigation techniques2077 and prioritization,2078 and the assistance of forensic experts can be  useful in this respect to improve the efficiency of procedures.
2082 One example is the forensic tool CIPAV (Computer and Internet Protocol Address Verifier) that  was  used  in  the  US  to  identify  a  suspect  who  had  been  using  anonymous  communication  services.2083  Another  example  of  cooperation  between  ISPs  and  investigators  is  e-mail  investigation.
E-mails  have  become  a  very  popular  means  of  communication.2084 To  avoid  identification,  offenders  sometimes  use  free e-mail addresses which they were able to register using fake personal information.
Since some crimes such as  phishing2086 and  the  commercial  distribution  of  child  pornography  include  financial  transactions,  one  strategy  to  in  the  transactions.2087 One  example  is  an  investigation  in  Germany  where  offenders  who  downloaded  child  pornography from a commercial website were identified on the basis of credit-card records.
To enable  such investigation, first responders usually seize all relevant storage devices – each of them potentially  carrying  millions  of  files  that  quite  often  pose  a  logistical  challenge.2092 As  pointed  out  above,  the  principles  of  relevance  and  effectiveness  are  of  great  importance  for  the  admissibility  of  digital  evidence.2093 Identifying and selecting the relevant hardware is therefore one of the major tasks within an  investigation.2094   An analysis of available hardware components can, for example, prove that the suspect’s computer was  capable  of  carrying  out  a  denial-of-service  attack 2095  or  is  equipped  with  a  chip  that  prevents  manipulations  of  the  operating  system.
If the suspect’s hardware profile  can be detected based on information from the software company, hardware analysis can be helpful to  verify that the seized computer system matches.
If, for example, the investigators find encryption software or tools used to delete  files  securely,  they  can  specifically  search  for  encrypted  or  deleted  evidence.2098 Investigators  can  also  determine  the  functions  of  computer  viruses  or  other  forms  of  malicious  software  and  reconstruct  software-operation  processes.2099 In  some  cases,  where  illegal  content  has  been  found  on  suspects’   242   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     computers, the suspects have claimed that they did not download the files but that it must have been  done  by  computer  virus.
This differentiation can be relevant, insofar as  some countries limit criminalization of the production of illegal devices to those that are either solely or  primarily designed to commit crimes.2101  Data-related investigations  are not confined to the software function, but also include analysis of non- executable files such as pdf-documents or video files.
These investigations range from content analysis of  specific  files  to  automatic  keyword  search2102 for  text  files  and  image  search  for  known  images  on  the  suspect’s computer.2103 File analysis also includes the examination of digital documents that might have  been  forged2104 as  well  as  metadata  investigation.2105 Such  analysis  can  determine  the  time2106 the  document was last opened or modified.2107 Furthermore, metadata analysis can be used to identify the  author of a file containing a threatening message, or the serial number of the camera that was used to  produce a child-pornography image.
Authors can also be identified based on linguistic analysis, which can  assist  in  determining  if  the  suspect  has  written  articles  before  and  left  information  that  can  help  identification in this context.2108    Tracking and reporting  One of the greatest challenges related to digital evidence is the fact that it is highly fragile and can rather  easily  be  deleted2109 or  modified.2110 As  pointed  out  above,  one  consequence  of  the  fragility  of  digital  evidence is the need to maintain its integrity.2111 Case records are therefore required.
While  the  presentation  of  evidence  in  court  is  customarily  undertaken  by  the  prosecution  and  defence  lawyers,  forensic experts can play an important role in criminal proceedings as expert witnesses who can help the  people involved in the court proceedings to understand the processes by which the evidence was created,  the procedures used to collect the evidence and evaluation of the evidence.2115 Given the complexity of  digital  evidence,  the  need  to  involve  forensic  experts  increases,  which  leads  de  facto  to  a  reliance  of  judges, juries, prosecutors and lawyers on expert statements.2116   Forensic examination operations  Although computer forensics deals to a large degree with computer hardware and computer data, it is not  necessarily always automated, and computer forensics remains to a large extent manual work.2117 This is  especially true with regard to the development of strategies and the search for possible evidence within  search and seizure procedures.
The amount of time necessary for such manual operations and the ability  of  offenders  to  automate  their  attacks  underline  the  challenges  that  law-enforcement  agencies  face,  especially  in  investigations  involving  a  large  number  of  suspects  and  large  data  volumes.2118 However,  some processes like the search for suspicious keywords or the recovery of deleted files can be automated  using special forensic analysis tools.2119   Safeguards   6.5.3  Over the last few years, law-enforcement agencies around the world have highlighted the urgent need for  adequate  investigation  instruments.2120 Taking  this  into  consideration,  it  is  perhaps  surprising  that  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  has  been  criticized  with  regard  to  procedural      243   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     instruments.2121 The criticism focuses mainly on the aspect that the Convention on Cybercrime contains a  number  of  provisions  that  establish  investigation  instruments  (Articles  16-21)  but  only  one  provision  (Article 15)  that  deals  with  safeguards.2122 In  addition,  it  can  be  noted  that  unlike  for  the  substantive  criminal law provisions in the Convention on Cybercrime, there are only very few possibilities for national  adjustments in respect of the implementation of the Convention on Cybercrime.2123 The criticism as such  focuses mainly on the quantitative aspects.
The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  was  designed  from  the  outset  as  an  international  framework  and  instrument  for  the  fight  against  cybercrime  that  is  not  limited  solely  to  the  Council  of  Europe member countries.2124 While negotiating the necessary procedural instruments, the drafters of the  Convention on Cybercrime, which included representatives from non-European countries like the United  States and Japan, realized that the existing national approaches related to safeguards and especially the  way these protected the suspect in the various criminal law systems were so different that it would not be  possible  to  provide  one  detailed  solution  for  all  Member  States.2125 The  drafters  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime therefore decided not to include specific regulations in the text of the Convention, but instead  to request Member States to ensure that fundamental national and international standards of safeguards  are applied.2126     Article 15 – Conditions and safeguards  1.
Each  Party  shall  ensure  that  the  establishment,  implementation  and  application  of  the  powers  and  procedures  provided  for  in  this  Section  are  subject  to  conditions  and  safeguards  provided  for  under  its  domestic  law,  which  shall  provide  for  the  adequate  protection  of  human  rights  and  liberties,  including  rights arising pursuant to obligations it has undertaken under the 1950 Council of Europe Convention for  the  Protection  of  Human  Rights  and  Fundamental  Freedoms,  the  1966  United  Nations  International  Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and other applicable international human rights instruments, and  which shall incorporate the principle of proportionality.
Such conditions and safeguards shall, as appropriate in view of the nature of the procedure or power  concerned, inter alia, include judicial or other independent supervision, grounds justifying application, and  limitation of the scope and the duration of such power or procedure.
If  the  law  provides  central  standards  that  apply  to  all  investigation  instruments, these principles shall apply to Internet-related instruments as well.2127 In case the domestic  law is not based on a centralized regulation of safeguards and conditions, it is necessary to analyse the  safeguards  and  conditions  implemented  with  regard  to  traditional  instruments  that  are  comparable  to  Internet-related instruments.
This  would  have  the  drawback  that  the  requirements  for  application  would  differ  in  such  a  way  that  the  positive  aspects  of  harmonization  would  no  longer  apply.
To  ensure  that  signatory  states  which  might  have  differing  legal  traditions  and  safeguards  in  place  implement  certain  standards2128,  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  defines  the  minimum  standards  by  referring  to  fundamental  frameworks,  such  as  the  1950  Council  of  Europe  Convention  for  the  Protection  of  Human  Rights  and  Fundamental Freedoms, the 1966 United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and  other applicable international human rights instruments.
As the Convention on Cybercrime can be signed and ratified also by countries that are not members of the  Council of Europe2129, it is important to highlight that not only the United Nations International Covenant  on Civil and Political Rights but also the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights   244   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     and Fundamental Freedoms will be taken into consideration when evaluating the systems of safeguards in  signatory states that are not members of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.
There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in  accordance  with  the  law  and  is  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the  interests  of  national  security,  public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the  protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
The  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  has  undertaken  efforts  to  define  more  precisely  standards  that  govern electronic investigations and especially surveillance.
Today, case law has become one of the most  important sources for international standards in respect of investigations related to communication.2130  The case law takes particularly into consideration the gravity of the interference of the investigation2131, its  purpose2132 and its proportionality.2133 Fundamental principles that can be extracted from case law are: the  need for a sufficient legal basis for investigation instruments2134, the requirement that the legal basis must  be  clear  with  regard  to  the  subject2135,  competences  of  the  law-enforcement  agencies  need  to  be  foreseeable2136 and surveillance of communication can only be justified in context of serious crimes.2137  In addition to this, Article 15 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime takes into account the  principle  of  proportionality.2138 This  provision  is  especially  relevant  for  signatory  states  that  are  not  members of the Council of Europe.
In cases where the existing national system of safeguards does not  adequately  protect  suspects,  it  is  mandatory  for  Member  States  to  develop  the  necessary  safeguards  within the ratification and implementation process.
Finally,  Article 15  paragraph  2  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime,  explicitly  refers  to  some  of  the  most  relevant  safeguards,2139 including  supervision,  grounds  justifying  application,  and  limitation of procedure with regard to scope and duration.
Unlike  the  fundamental  principles  described  above,  the  safeguards  mentioned  here  do  not  necessarily  need to be implemented with regard to any instrument but only if appropriate in view of the nature of  the procedure concerned.
The decision as to when this is the case is left to the national legislatures.2140  An important aspect related to the system of safeguards provided by the Council of Europe Convention on  Cybercrime is the fact that the ability of law-enforcement agencies to use the instruments in a flexible  way  on  the  one  hand  and  the  guarantee  of  effective  safeguards  on  the  other  depends  on  the  implementation  of  a  graded  system  of  safeguards.
The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  does  not  explicitly  hinder the parties from implementing the same safeguards (e.g.
the requirement of a court order) for all  instruments, but such an approach would influence the flexibility of the law-enforcement agencies.
There  are  a  number  of  examples  of  such  differentiation  in  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime that enable the parties to further develop a system of graded safeguards.
These include the  following:  Differentiation  between  the  interception  of  content  data  (Article 21)2141 and  the  collection  of  traffic data (Article 20)2142.
2146  And  finally,  differentiation  between  the  obligation  to  submit  “subscriber  information”2147 and “computer data”2148 in Article 18.2149       245   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     If  the  intensity  of  an  investigation  instrument  and  the  potential  impact  on  a  suspect  are  correctly  evaluated and the safeguards are designed in line with the results of the analysis, the system of graded  safeguards does not lead to an unbalanced system of procedural instruments.
6.5.4   Expedited  preservation  and  disclosure  of  stored  computer  data  (Quick  freeze  procedure)   The identification of an offender who has committed a cybercrime often requires the analysis of traffic  data.2150 The IP address, in particular, can help law-enforcement agencies to trace the offender.
As long as  the law-enforcement agencies have access to the relevant traffic data, it is in some cases even possible to  identify an offender who is using public Internet terminals that do not require identification.2151   One of the main difficulties that investigators face is that traffic data highly relevant for the information in  question are often automatically deleted after a rather short period of time.
the  sending  out  of  an  e-mail,  accessing  the  Internet or downloading a movie), the traffic data that were generated during the process and enabled  the  process  to  be  carried  out  are  no  longer  needed.
From  an  economic  point  of  view,  most  Internet  providers are interested in deleting the information as soon as possible, since storing the data for longer  periods would require even larger (expensive) storage capacity.2152   However, the economic aspects do not constitute the only reason why law-enforcement agencies need to  carry out their investigations quickly.
Traffic  data  relating  to  subscribers  and  users  processed  and  stored  by  the  provider  of  a  public  communications network or publicly available electronic communications service must be erased or made  anonymous when it is no longer needed for the purpose of the transmission of a communication without  prejudice to paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of this Article and Article 15(1).
Time is therefore a critical aspect of Internet investigations.
In general, since it is likely that some time will  elapse  between  the  perpetration  of  a  crime,  its  discovery,  and  notification  of  the  law-enforcement  agencies, it is important to implement mechanisms that prevent relevant data from being deleted during  the sometimes lengthy investigation process.
A data-retention obligation forces the provider of Internet services to save traffic data for a certain period  of time.2155 In the latest legislative approaches, the records need to be saved for up to 24 months.2156 This  would  enable  law-enforcement  agencies  to  obtain  access  to  data  that  are  necessary  to  identify  an  offender  even  months  after  perpetration  of  the  crime.2157 A  data-retention  obligation  was  recently  adopted  by  the  European  Parliament2158 and  is  currently  also  under  discussion  in  the  United  States.2159  With regard to the principles of data retention, more information can be found below.
Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to enable its competent  authorities to order or similarly obtain the expeditious preservation of specified computer data, including  traffic data, that has been stored by means of a computer system, in particular where there are grounds to  believe that the computer data is particularly vulnerable to loss or modification.
Where a Party gives effect to paragraph 1 above by means of an order to a person to preserve specified  stored computer data in the person’s possession or control, the Party shall adopt such legislative and other  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  oblige  that  person  to  preserve  and  maintain  the  integrity  of  that  computer data for a period of time as long as necessary, up to a maximum of ninety days, to enable the  competent authorities to seek its disclosure.
Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to oblige the custodian  or  other  person  who  is  to  preserve  the  computer  data  to  keep  confidential  the  undertaking  of  such  procedures for the period of time provided for by its domestic law.
Seen from an Internet service provider’s perspective, data preservation is a less constraining instrument  compared to data retention.2163 ISPs do not need to store all data for all users, but instead have to ensure  that  specific  data  are  not  deleted  as  soon  as  they  receive  an  order  from  a  competent  authority.
It is not necessary to preserve the data from millions  of  Internet  users  but  only  data  that  are  related  to  possible  suspects  in  criminal  investigations.
Article 16 does not force the provider to start collecting  information it would not normally store.2165 In addition, Article 16 does not oblige the provider to transfer  the relevant data to the authorities.
The  advantage of a separation of the obligation to preserve the data and the obligation to disclose them is the  fact that it is possible to require different conditions for application of the two obligations.2166 In view of  the importance of immediate reaction, it would for example be supportive to waive the requirement for  an order by a judge and enable the prosecution or police to order the preservation.2167 This would enable  the  competent  authorities  to  react  faster.
Protection  of  the  suspect’s  rights  can  then  be  achieved  by  requiring a judge’s order for the disclosure of the data.2168   The  disclosure  of  the  preserved  data  is  among  other  aspects  regulated  in  Article 18  of  the  Council  of  Europe Convention on Cybercrime:    Article 18 – Production order  1.
Each  Party  shall  adopt  such  legislative  and  other  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  empower  its  competent authorities to order:     a. a person in its territory to submit specified computer data in that person’s possession or control,  which is stored in a computer system or a computer-data storage medium; and  b.  a  service  provider  offering  its  services  in  the  territory  of  the  Party  to  submit  subscriber  information relating to such services in that service provider’s possession or control.
For the purpose of this article, the term “subscriber information” means any information contained in  the form of computer data or any other form that is held by a service provider, relating to subscribers of its  services other than traffic or content data and by which can be established:     a. the type of communication service used, the technical provisions taken thereto and the period of  service;  b.  the  subscriber’s  identity,  postal  or  geographic  address,  telephone  and  other  access  number,  billing and payment information, available on the basis of the service agreement or arrangement;  c. any other information on the site of the installation of communication equipment, available on  the basis of the service agreement or arrangement.
Compared to the actual seizure of hardware, the order to submit the  relevant information is in general less constraining.
Its application is therefore especially relevant in cases  where forensic investigations do not require access to the hardware.
In addition to the obligation to submit computer data, Article 18 of the Council of Europe Convention on  Cybercrime  enables  law-enforcement  agencies  to  order  the  submission  of  subscriber  information.
Based  on  Article 18, paragraph 1.b of the Convention on Cybercrime, a provider is obliged to submit the subscriber  information listed in Article 18, paragraph 3.2171   In cases where the law-enforcement agencies trace back the route to an offender and need immediate  access to identify the path through which the communication was transmitted, Article 17 enables them to  order the expedited partial disclosure of traffic data.
Each Party shall adopt, in respect of traffic data that is to be preserved under Article 16, such legislative  and other measures as may be necessary to:     a. ensure that such expeditious preservation of traffic data is available regardless of whether one or  more service providers were involved in the transmission of that communication; and  b. ensure the expeditious disclosure to the Party’s competent authority, or a person designated by  that  authority,  of  a  sufficient  amount  of  traffic  data  to  enable  the  Party  to  identify  the  service  providers and the path through which the communication was transmitted.
As mentioned above, the Convention on Cybercrime strictly separates the obligation to preserve data on  request and the obligation to disclose them to the competent authorities.2172 Article 17 provides a clear  classification,  as  it  combines  the  obligation  to  ensure  the  preservation  of  traffic  data  in  cases  where  a  number of service providers were involved with the obligation to disclose the necessary information to  identify the transmission path.
Commonwealth Computer and Computer-related Crimes Model Law   Similar approaches can be found in the 2002 Commonwealth Model Law.2174   248   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     The provision    Production of data  15  If a magistrate is satisfied on the basis of an application by a police officer that specified computer  data, or a printout or other information, is reasonably required for the purpose of a criminal investigation  or criminal proceedings, the magistrate may order that:     (a) a person in the territory of [enacting country] in control of a computer system produce from the  system specified computer data or a printout or other intelligible output of that data; and  (b)  an  Internet  service  provider  in  [enacting  country]  produce  information  about  persons  who  subscribe to or otherwise use the service; and  (c)2175 a person in the territory of [enacting country] who has access to a specified computer system  process and compile specified computer data from the system and give it to a specified person.
Disclosure of stored traffic data  16.2176 If a police officer is satisfied that data stored in a computer system is reasonably required for the  purposes of a criminal investigation, the police officer may, by written notice given to a person in control  of  the  computer  system,  require  the  person  to  disclose  sufficient  traffic  data  about  a  specified  communication to identify:      Preservation of data  17.
(a)  data  stored  in  a  computer  system  is  reasonably  required  for  the  purposes  of  a  criminal  investigation; and  (b) there is a risk that the data may be destroyed or rendered inaccessible;     the police officer may, by written notice given to a person in control of the computer system, require the  person to ensure that the data specified in the notice be preserved for a period of up to 7 days as specified  in the notice.
Data retention   6.5.5  A data-retention obligation forces the provider of Internet services to save traffic data for a certain period  of  time.2177 The  implementation  of  a  data  retention  obligation  is  an  approach  to  avoid  the  above- mentioned difficulties of gaining access to traffic data before they are deleted.
By  way  of  derogation  from  Articles  5,  6  and  9  of  Directive  2002/58/EC,  Member  States  shall  adopt  measures to ensure that the data specified in Article 5 of this Directive are retained in accordance with the  provisions  thereof,  to  the  extent  that  those  data  are  generated  or  processed  by  providers  of  publicly  available  electronic  communications  services  or  of  a  public  communications  network  within  their  jurisdiction in the process of supplying the communications services concerned.
The  obligation  to  retain  data  provided  for  in  paragraph  1  shall  include  the  retention  of  the  data  specified in Article 5 relating to unsuccessful call attempts where those data are generated or processed,  and  stored  (as  regards  telephony  data)  or  logged  (as  regards  Internet  data),  by  providers  of  publicly  available electronic communications services or of a public communications network within the jurisdiction  of the Member State concerned in the process of supplying the communication services concerned.
This  Directive shall not require data relating to unconnected calls to be retained.
249   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Article 4 – Access to data   Member States shall adopt measures to ensure that data retained in accordance with this Directive are  provided only to the competent national authorities in specific cases and in accordance with national law.
The procedures to be followed and the conditions to be fulfilled in order to gain access to retained data in  accordance with necessity and proportionality requirements shall be defined by each Member State in its  national law, subject to the relevant provisions of European Union law or public international law, and in  particular the ECHR as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights.
Member States shall ensure that the following categories of data are retained under this Directive:                  (i) the user ID(s) allocated;   (ii) the user ID and telephone number allocated to any communication entering the public  telephone network;   (iii) the name and address of the subscriber or registered user to whom an Internet Protocol  (IP) address, user ID or telephone number was allocated at the time of the communication;    (i) the calling telephone number;   (ii) the name and address of the subscriber or registered user;    (2) concerning Internet access, Internet e-mail and Internet telephony:    (a) data necessary to trace and identify the source of a communication:    (1) concerning fixed network telephony and mobile telephony:    (b) data necessary to identify the destination of a communication:   (1) concerning fixed network telephony and mobile telephony:                                                              250   (i)  the  number(s)  dialled  (the  telephone  number(s)  called),  and,  involving  supplementary services such as call forwarding or call transfer, the number or numbers to  which the call is routed;   (ii) the name(s) and address(es) of the subscriber(s) or registered user(s);   in  cases   (2) concerning Internet e-mail and Internet telephony:    (i) the user ID or telephone number of the intended recipient(s) of an Internet telephony call;   (ii) the name(s) and address(es) of the subscriber(s) or registered user(s) and user ID of the  intended recipient of the communication;    (c) data necessary to identify the date, time and duration of a communication:    (1) concerning fixed network telephony and mobile telephony, the date and time of the start and  end of the communication;   (2) concerning Internet access, Internet e-mail and Internet telephony:    (i)  the  date  and  time  of  the  log-in  and  log-off  of  the  Internet  access  service,  based  on  a  certain time zone, together with the IP address, whether dynamic or static, allocated by the  Internet  access  service  provider  to  a  communication,  and  the  user  ID  of  the  subscriber  or  registered user;   (ii)  the  date  and  time  of  the  log-in  and  log-off  of  the  Internet  e-mail  service  or  Internet  telephony service, based on a certain time zone;    (d) data necessary to identify the type of communication:    (1) concerning fixed network telephony and mobile telephony: the telephone service used;   (2) concerning Internet e-mail and Internet telephony: the Internet service used;    (e)  data  necessary  to  identify  users’  communication  equipment  or  what  purports  to  be  their  equipment:    (1) concerning fixed network telephony, the calling and called telephone numbers;   (2) concerning mobile telephony:    (i) the calling and called telephone numbers;   (ii) the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) of the calling party;   (iii) the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) of the calling party;   (iv) the IMSI of the called party;   (v) the IMEI of the called party;   (vi) in the case of pre-paid anonymous services, the date and time of the initial activation of  the service and the location label (Cell ID) from which the service was activated;    Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response   (3) concerning Internet access, Internet e-mail and Internet telephony:    (i) the calling telephone number for dial-up access;   (ii) the digital subscriber line (DSL) or other end point of the originator of the communication;                            (f) data necessary to identify the location of mobile communication equipment:    (1) the location label (Cell ID) at the start of the communication;   (2) data identifying the geographic location of cells by reference to their location labels (Cell ID)  during the period for which communications data are retained.
Article 7 – Data protection and data security   Without  prejudice  to  the  provisions  adopted  pursuant  to  Directive  95/46/EC  and  Directive  2002/58/EC,  each Member State shall ensure that providers of publicly available electronic communications services or  of a public communications network respect, as a minimum, the following data security principles with  respect to data retained in accordance with this Directive:      (a) the retained data shall be of the same quality and subject to the same security and protection as  those data on the network;   (b) the data shall be subject to appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the  data  against  accidental  or  unlawful  destruction,  accidental  loss  or  alteration,  or  unauthorised  or  unlawful storage, processing, access or disclosure;   (c) the data shall be subject to appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that  they can be accessed by specially authorised personnel only; and   (d) the data, except those that have been accessed and preserved, shall be destroyed at the end of  the period of retention.
Article 8 – Storage requirements for retained data   Member  States  shall  ensure  that  the  data  specified  in  Article  5  are  retained  in  accordance  with  this  Directive in such a way that the data retained and any other necessary information relating to such data  can be transmitted upon request to the competent authorities without undue delay.
The fact that key information about any communication on the Internet will be covered by the Directive  has prompted intense criticism from human rights organizations.2179 This could in turn lead to a review of  the Directive and its implementation by constitutional courts.2180 In addition, in her conclusion in the case  Productores de Música de España (Promusicae) v. Telefónica de España,2181 the adviser to the European  Court of Justice, Advocate General Juliane Kokott, pointed out that it is questionable whether the data- retention  obligation  can  be  implemented  without  a  violation  of  fundamental  rights.2182 Difficulties  with  regard to the implementation of such regulations were already pointed out by the G8 in 2001.2183   But the criticism is not limited to this aspect.
The easiest  ways to circumvent the data retention obligation include the use of different public Internet terminals or  prepaid  mobile  phone  data  services  that  do  not  require  registration2184 and  the  use  of  anonymous  communication  services  that  are  (at  least  partially)  operated  in  countries  where  the  data-retention  obligation is not applied.2185  If offenders use different public terminals or prepaid mobile phone data services where they do not need  to  register  the  data  stored  by  the  providers,  the  data-retention  obligation  will  only  lead  the  law- enforcement agencies to the service provider but not to the actual offender.2186   Offenders can in addition circumvent the data-retention obligation by using anonymous communication  servers.2187 In this case, law-enforcement agencies might be able to prove the fact that the offender used  an  anonymous  communication  server,  but,  having  no  access  to  traffic  data  in  the  country  where  the  anonymous  communication  server  is  located,  they  will  not  be  able  to  prove  the  participation  of  the  offender in the perpetration of a criminal offence.2188       251   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Given that it is very easy to circumvent the provision, the implementation of the data-retention legislation  in the European Union is coupled with the fear that the process will require side-measures necessary to  ensure the effectiveness of the instrument.
Possible side-measures could include the obligation to register  prior to the use of online services2189 or a ban on the use of anonymous communication technology.2190    Search and seizure    6.5.6  Although new investigation instruments like real-time collection of content data and the use of remote  forensic  software  to  identify  an  offender  are  under  discussion  and  already  implemented  by  some  countries, search and seizure remains one of the most important investigation instruments.2191 As soon as  the offender is identified and law enforcement seizes his IT equipment, the computer forensic experts can  analyse the equipment to collect the evidence necessary for the prosecution.2192   The possibility of replacing or amending the search and seizure procedure is currently being discussed in  some European countries and in the United States.2193 One way to avoid the need to enter the suspect’s  house to search and seize computer equipment would be to perform an online search.
This instrument,  which will be described more in detail in sections below, describes a procedure where law-enforcement  agencies access the suspect’s computer via the Internet to perform secret search procedures.2194 Although  law-enforcement agencies could clearly benefit from the fact that the suspect does not realize that the  investigation  is  being  carried  out,  physical  access  to  the  hardware  enables  more  efficient  investigation  techniques.2195 This  underlines  the  important  role  of  search  and  seizure  procedures  within  Internet  investigation.
Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime  Most  national  criminal  procedural  laws  contain  provisions  that  enable  law-enforcement  agencies  to  search  and  seize  objects.2196 The  reason  why  the  drafters  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime nevertheless included a provision dealing with search and seizure is that national laws often  do  not  cover  data-related  search  and  seizure  procedures.2197 Some  countries,  for  example,  limit  the  application  of  seizure  procedures  to  seizing  physical  objects.2198 Based  on  such  provisions,  investigators  are able to seize an entire server but not seize only the relevant data by copying them from the server.
This can cause difficulties in cases where the relevant information is stored on a server together with the  data of hundreds of other users, which would no longer be available after the law-enforcement agencies  have seized that server.
Another example where traditional search and seizure of tangible items is not  sufficient is the case where the law-enforcement agencies do not know the physical location of the server  but are able to access it via the Internet.2199 Article 19, like other procedural instruments provided by the  Convention on Cybercrime, does not specify the conditions and requirements that must be fulfilled for  investigators  to  carry  out  such  investigations.
The  provision  itself  neither  states  that  a  court  order  is  necessary nor defines under what circumstances an exception to the requirement of a court order can be  made.
Each  Party  shall  adopt  such  legislative  and  other  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  empower  its  competent authorities to search or similarly access:       [...]    Although the search and seizure procedure is an instrument that is frequently used by investigators, there  are  a  number  of  challenges  that  accompany  its  application  in  cybercrime  investigations.2203 One  of  the  main difficulties is that search orders are often limited to certain places (e.g.
252   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     With regard to the search for computer data it can turn out during the investigation that the suspect did  not store them on local hard drives but on an external server that was accessed via the Internet.2205 Using  Internet servers to store data and process data is becoming increasingly popular amongst Internet users  (“cloud  computing”).
One  of  the  advantages  of  storing  information  on  an  Internet  server  is  that  the  information can be accessed from any place with an Internet connection.
If  the  investigators  discover that relevant information is stored on another computer system, they should be  able to extend the search to that system.2206 The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime addresses  this issue in Article 19 paragraph 2.
Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to ensure that where its  authorities search or similarly access a specific computer system or part of it, pursuant to paragraph 1.a,  and have grounds to believe that the data sought is stored in another computer system or part of it in its  territory, and such data is lawfully accessible from or available to the initial system, the authorities shall be  able to expeditiously extend the search or similar accessing to the other system.
If the investigators come to the conclusion  that the seizure of the hardware that is used to store the information is not necessary or would not be  adequate,  they  may  still  need  other  instruments  that  enable  them  to  continue  the  search  and  seizure  procedure with regard to the stored computer data.2207 The necessary instruments are not limited to the  act of copying the relevant data.2208 In addition, there are a number of side-measures that are necessary  to maintain required efficiency, such as the seizure of the computer system itself.
The most important  aspect is maintaining the integrity of the copied data.2209 If the investigators do not have permission to  take  the  necessary  measures  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  the  copied  data,  the  copied  data  may  not  be  accepted as evidence in criminal proceedings.2210 After the investigators have copied the data and taken  measures  to  maintain  its  integrity,  they  will  need  to  decide  how  to  treat  the  original  data.
Since  investigators will not remove the hardware during the seizure process, the information would in general  remain  there.
Each  Party  shall  adopt  such  legislative  and  other  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  empower  its  competent authorities to seize or similarly secure computer data accessed according to paragraphs 1 or 2.
These measures shall include the power to:          [...]    One more challenge regarding search orders pertaining to computer data is the fact that it is sometimes  difficult for law-enforcement agencies to find the location of the data.
Even  when  the  exact  location  is  known,  the  amount  of  stored data often hinders expedited investigations.2213 In these cases, the investigations present unique  difficulties, insofar as they have an international dimension that requires international cooperation within  the investigations.2214 Even when the investigations are related to computer systems located within the   a. seize or similarly secure a computer system or part of it or a computer-data storage medium;  b. make and retain a copy of those computer data;   c. maintain the integrity of the relevant stored computer data;  d. render inaccessible or remove those computer data in the accessed computer system.
Very often the investigators will not be able to identify  the exact location with the help of the system administrator responsible for the server infrastructure.2215  But  even  when  they  are  able  to  identify  the  specific  hard  drive,  protection  measures  might  stop  them  from searching for the relevant data.
The drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime decided to address  this  issue  by  implementing  a  coercive  measure  to  facilitate  the  search  and  seizure  of  computer  data.
Although  the  obligation  to  follow  the  orders  of  the  investigator  is  limited  to  necessary information and support for the case, this instrument changes the nature of search and seizure  procedures.
With  regard to a person who has special knowledge that is needed by the investigators, implementation of the  Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime will change the situation in two ways.
First of all they will  need  to  provide  the  necessary  information  to  the  investigators.
The obligation to provide – reasonable – support to the investigators will relieve the person  with special knowledge from contractual obligations or orders given by supervisors.2216 The Convention on  Cybercrime does not define the term “reasonable”, but the Explanatory Report points out that reasonable  “may include disclosing a password or other security measure to the investigating authorities” but does in  general not cover “the disclosure of the password or other security measure” where this would go along  with  “unreasonably  threaten  the  privacy  of  other  users  or  other  data  that  is  not  authorised  to  be  searched”.2217    Article 19 – Search and seizure of stored computer data   [...]  4.
Each  Party  shall  adopt  such  legislative  and  other  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  empower  its  competent  authorities  to  order  any  person  who  has  knowledge  about  the  functioning  of  the  computer  system  or  measures  applied  to  protect  the  computer  data  therein  to  provide,  as  is  reasonable,  the  necessary information, to enable the undertaking of the measures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.
In this Part:  [...]  “seize” includes:        [...]   (a) make and retain a copy of computer data, including by using onsite equipment; and  (b) render inaccessible, or remove, computer data in the accessed computer system; and  (c) take a printout of output of computer data.
(1)  If  a  magistrate  is  satisfied  on  the  basis  of  [information  on  oath]  [affidavit]  that  there  are  reasonable grounds [to suspect] [to believe] that there may be in a place a thing or computer data:      the magistrate [may] [shall] issue a warrant authorising a [law enforcement] [police] officer, with such  assistance as may be necessary, to enter the place to search and seize the thing or computer data.
(1) A person who is in possession or control of a computer data storage medium or computer system  that is the subject of a search under section 12 must permit, and assist if required, the person making the  search to:      (a) access and use a computer system or computer data storage medium to search any computer  data available to or in the system; and  (b) obtain and copy that computer data; and  (c) use equipment to make copies; and  (d) obtain an intelligible output from a computer system in a plain text format that can be read by a  person.
Production order   6.5.7  Even  if  an  obligation  like  the  one  in  Article 19  paragraph  4  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  is  not  implemented  in  national  law,  providers  will  often  cooperate  with  law-enforcement  agencies to avoid a negative impact on their business.
If – due to a lack of cooperation of the provider –  investigators are unable to find the data or the storage devices they need to search and seize, it is likely  that the investigators will need to seize more hardware than actually necessary.
Each  Party  shall  adopt  such  legislative  and  other  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  empower  its  competent authorities to order:     a. a person in its territory to submit specified computer data in that person’s possession or control,  which is stored in a computer system or a computer-data storage medium; and  b.  a  service  provider  offering  its  services  in  the  territory  of  the  Party  to  submit  subscriber  information relating to such services in that service provider’s possession or control.
Based  on  Article 18  paragraph 1.a,  any  person  (including  service  provider)  is  obliged  to  submit  specified  computer  data  that  are  in  the  person’s  possession  or  control.
The  term  “possession”  requires  that  the  person  have  physical  access  to  the  data  storage  devices  where  the  specified  information  is  stored.2223 The  application  of  the  provision  is  extended  by  the  term  “control”.
Data are under control of a person if he/she has no physical access but is managing the information.
In the  Explanatory Report, the drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime nevertheless point out that the mere  technical ability to remotely access stored data does not necessary constitute control.2224 The application  of Article 18 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime is therefore limited to cases where the  degree of control of the suspect goes beyond the potential possibility to access the data.
Based  on  Article 18  Subparagraph 1b), investigators can order a service provider to submit subscriber information.
Subscriber      255   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     information  can  be  necessary  to  identify  an  offender.
If  the  investigators  are  able  to  discover  the  IP  address that was used by the offender, they need to link this number to a person.2225 In most cases, the IP  address only leads to the Internet provider that provided the IP address to the user.
Before enabling the  use of a service, Internet providers generally require a user to register with his subscriber information.2226  Article 18 paragraph 1.b permits investigators to order the provider to submit this subscriber information.
In  this  context,  it  is  important  to  highlight  that  Article 18  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime does not, however, impose either a data-retention obligation2227 or an obligation for service  providers to register subscriber information.2228   The  differentiation  between  “computer  data”  in  Subparagraph  1a)  and  “subscriber  information”  in  Subparagraph 1b) seems at first sight not to be necessary, insofar as subscriber information that is stored  in digital form is also covered by Subparagraph 1a).
The first reason for the differentiation stems from the  different definitions of “computer data” and “subscriber information”.
Unlike “computer data”, the term  “subscriber  information”  does  not  require  that  the  information  be  stored  as  computer  data.
Article 18  Subparagraph 1b)  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  enables  the  competent  law  authorities to submit information that is kept in non-digital form.2229     Article 1 – Definitions   For the purposes of this Convention:   [...]  b.
“computer  data”  means  any  representation  of  facts,  information  or  concepts  in  a  form  suitable  for  processing in a computer system, including a program suitable to cause a computer system to perform a  function;      Article 18 – Production order  [...]  3.
For the purpose of this article, the term “subscriber information” means any information contained in  the form of computer data or any other form that is held by a service provider, relating to subscribers of its  services other than traffic or content data and by which can be established:      a. the type of communication service used, the technical provisions taken thereto and the period of  service;   b.  the  subscriber’s  identity,  postal  or  geographic  address,  telephone  and  other  access  number,  billing and payment information, available on the basis of the service agreement or arrangement;   c. any other information on the site of the installation of communication equipment, available on  the basis of the service agreement or arrangement.
The second reason for the distinction between “computer data” and “subscriber information” is that it  enables  law-makers  to  implement  different  requirements  with  regard  to  the  application  of  the  instruments.2230 It is for example possible to impose stricter requirements2231 for a production order under  Subparagraph 1b),  as  this  instrument  allows  law-enforcement  agencies  to  get  access  to  any  kind  of  computer data, including content data.2232 The differentiation between the real-time collection of traffic  data (Article 20)2233 and the real-time collection of content data (Article 21)2234 shows that the drafters of  the Convention on Cybercrime realized that, depending on the kind of data law-enforcement agencies get  access to, different safeguards need to be implemented.2235 With the differentiation between “computer  data” and “subscriber information”, Article 18 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime enables  the  signatory  states  to  develop  a  similar  system  of  graded  safeguards  with  regard  to  the  production  order.2236    Commonwealth Computer and Computer-related Crimes Model Law   A similar approach can be found in the 2002 Commonwealth Model Law.2237     256   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Production of data   15.
If a magistrate is satisfied on the basis of an application by a police officer that specified computer  data, or a printout or other information, is reasonably required for the purpose of a criminal investigation  or criminal proceedings, the magistrate may order that:     (a) a person in the territory of [enacting country] in control of a computer system produce from the  system specified computer data or a printout or other intelligible output of that data; and  (b)  an  Internet  service  provider  in  [enacting  country]  produce  information  about  persons  who  subscribe to or otherwise use the service; and  (c)2238 a person in the territory of [enacting country] who has access to a specified computer system  process and compile specified computer data from the system and give it to a specified person.
The  instrument  allows  investigators  to  collect  valuable  information,  although  it  is  limited  to  information  exchanged  over  the  observed lines/phones.
letters) or lines that are not  included in the observation, the investigators will not be able to record the conversation.
An  increasing  amount  of  voice  communication  is  performed  using  technology based on Internet protocols (voice-over-IP).2241 Seen from a technical point of view, a voice- over-IP phone call is much more comparable to the exchange of e-mails than to a conventional phone call  using the telephone wire, and the interception of this type of call presents unique difficulties.
2242   Since many computer crimes involve the exchange of data, the ability to also intercept these processes or  otherwise use data related to the exchange process can become an essential requirement for successful  investigations.
From  a  legal  point  of  view,  authorization  to  record  a  telephone  conversation  does  not  necessarily  include  authorization to intercept data-transfer processes.
The distinction between “content data” and “traffic data” is the same as the differentiation used in most  related national laws.2245      257   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     6.5.9   Collection of traffic data   Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime  Bearing in mind that the definition of traffic data varies from country to country,2246 the drafters of the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  decided  to  define  this  term  in  order  to  improve  the  application  of  the  related  provision  in  international  investigations.
Whenever a user connects to the Internet, downloads  e-mails  or  opens  a  website,  traffic  data  is  generated.
Although access to the content data might be necessary in some  cases as it enables law-enforcement agencies to analyse the communication much more effectively, traffic  data  plays  an  important  role  in  cybercrime  investigation.2248 While  access  to  content  data  enables  law- enforcement  agencies  to  analyse  the  nature  of  the  messages  or  files  exchanged,  traffic  data  can  be  necessary  to  identify  an  offender.
By  monitoring the traffic data generated during the use of Internet services, law-enforcement agencies are  able to identify the IP address of the server and can then try to determine its physical location.
Each  Party  shall  adopt  such  legislative  and  other  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  empower  its  competent authorities to:           a. collect or record through the application of technical means on the territory of that Party, and   b. compel a service provider, within its existing technical capability:   i. to collect or record through the application of technical means on the territory of that Party; or  ii.
Where  a  Party,  due  to  the  established  principles  of  its  domestic  legal  system,  cannot  adopt  the  measures referred to in paragraph 1.a, it may instead adopt legislative and other measures as may be  necessary  to  ensure  the  real-time  collection  or  recording  of  traffic  data  associated  with  specified  communications transmitted in its territory, through the application of technical means on that territory.
Each  Party  shall  adopt  such  legislative  and  other  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  oblige  a  service  provider to keep confidential the fact of the execution of any power provided for in this article and any  information relating to it.
Article 20 contains two different approaches for the collection of traffic data, both of which are supposed  to be implemented.2249   The  first  approach  is  to  impose  an  obligation  on  Internet  service  providers  to  enable  law-enforcement  agencies to collect the relevant data directly.
This generally requires the installation of an interface which  law-enforcement agencies can use to access the Internet service provider’s infrastructure.2250   The second approach is to enable law-enforcement agencies to compel an Internet service provider to  collect  data  at  their  request.
One  of  the  intentions  behind  combining the two approaches is to ensure that if providers do not have the technology in place to record  the  data,  law-enforcement  agencies  should  be  able  to  carry  out  the  investigation  (based  on  Article 20  paragraph 1.b) without the assistance of the provider.2251    258   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  is  neither  drafted  with  preference  to  a  specific  technology nor intended to set standards that result in the need for high financial investments for the  industry  involved.2252 From  that  perspective,  Article 20  paragraph 1.a  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  seems to be the better solution.
However, the regulation in Article 20 paragraph 2 shows that the drafters  of the Convention on Cybercrime were aware that some countries might have difficulties in implementing  legislation that enables law-enforcement agencies to carry out the investigations directly.
As explained above,2253 offenders can use services in the Internet that enable anonymous  communication.
Offenders can achieve a similar result by using public Internet terminals.2255   Compared to traditional search and seizure procedures, one of the advantages of the collection of traffic  data is that the suspect of a crime does not necessary realize that an investigation is taking place.2256 This  limits his/her possibilities to manipulate or delete evidence.
To ensure that offenders are not informed by  the  service  provider  about  the  ongoing  investigation,  Article 20  paragraph 3  addresses  this  issue  and  obliges the signatory states to implement legislation that ensures that service providers keep knowledge  of the ongoing investigation confidential.
For the service provider, this is coupled with the advantage that  the provider is relieved from the obligation2257 to inform the users.2258   The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime was designed to improve and harmonize legislation with  regard to cybercrime-related issues.2259 In this context, it is important to highlight that based on the text in  Article 21 thereof, the provision does not only apply to cybercrime-related offences, but to any offence.
(1)  If  a  police  officer  is  satisfied  that  traffic  data  associated  with  a  specified  communication  is  reasonably required for the purposes of a criminal investigation, the police officer may, by written notice  given to a person in control of such data, request that person to:     (a)  collect  or  record  traffic  data  associated  with  a  specified  communication  during  a  specified  period; and  (b) permit and assist a specified police officer to collect or record that data.
(2) If a magistrate is satisfied on the basis of [information on oath] [affidavit] that there are reasonable  grounds [to suspect] that traffic data is reasonably required for the purposes of a criminal investigation,  the magistrate [may] [shall] authorize a police officer to collect or record traffic data associated with a  specified communication during a specified period through application of technical means.
The  possibility  to  intercept  data-exchange  processes  can  be  important  in  cases  where  law-enforcement  agencies already know who the communication partners are but have no information about the type of  information exchanged.
Article 21 gives them the possibility to record data communication and analyse      259   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     the  content.2262 This  includes  files  downloaded  from  websites  or  file-sharing  systems,  e-mails  sent  or  received by the offender and chat conversations.
Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary, in relation to a range  of serious offences to be determined by domestic law, to empower its competent authorities to:             i. to collect or record through the application of technical means on the territory of that Party, or  ii.
Where  a  Party,  due  to  the  established  principles  of  its  domestic  legal  system,  cannot  adopt  the  measures referred to in paragraph 1.a, it may instead adopt legislative and other measures as may be  necessary to ensure the real-time collection or recording of content data on specified communications in  its territory through the application of technical means on that territory.
Each  Party  shall  adopt  such  legislative  and  other  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  oblige  a  service  provider to keep confidential the fact of the execution of any power provided for in this article and any  information relating to it.
Examples of content data in cybercrime investigations include:    •  •  •   the subject of an e-mail;   content on a website opened by the suspect;  the content of a VoIP conversation.
One  of  the  most  important  difficulties  for  investigations  based  on  Article 21  is  the  use  of  encryption  technology.2263 As explained in detail previously, the use of encryption technology can enable offenders to  protect the content exchanged in a way that makes it impossible for law-enforcement agencies to gain  access to it.
Without access to the key that  was used to encrypt the files, any possible decryption could take a very long time.2264   Commonwealth Computer and Computer-related Crimes Model Law   A similar approach can be found in the 2002 Commonwealth Model Law.2265    Interception of electronic communications  18.
(1) If a [magistrate] [judge] is satisfied on the basis of [information on oath] [affidavit] that there are  reasonable grounds [to suspect][to believe] that the content of electronic communications is reasonably  required for the purposes of a criminal investigation, the magistrate [may] [shall]:     (a)  order  an  Internet  service  provider  whose  service  is  available  in  [enacting  country]  through  application of technical means to collect or record or to permit or assist competent authorities with  the collection or recording of content data associated with specified communications transmitted by  means of a computer system; or   (b) authorize a police officer to collect or record that data through application of technical means.
260   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     6.5.11  Regulation regarding encryption technology  As  described  above,  offenders  can  also  hinder  content-data  analysis  by  using  encryption  technology.
Various  software  products  are  available  that  enable  users  to  effectively  protect  files  as  well  as  data- transfer  processes  against  unauthorized  access.2266 If  suspects  have  used  such  a  product  and  the  investigation authorities do not have access to the key that was used to encrypt the files, the required  decryption could take a long time.2267   The use of encryption technology by offenders is a challenge for law-enforcement agencies.2268 There are  various national and international approaches2269 to address the problem.2270 Owing to differing estimates  of  the  threat  of  encryption  technology,  there  is  as  yet  no  widely  accepted  international  approach  to  address the topic.
Opponents of such a solution fear that the limitations would not only enable  investigators to break encryption, but also economic spies trying to obtain access to encrypted business  information.2274 In addition, the restriction would only stop offenders using a stronger encryption if such  software tools are available.
This would first of all require international standards to prevent producers of  strong encryption products from offering their software in countries without proper restrictions on key  length.
In any event, offenders could relatively easily develop their own encryption software with no limit  on key length.
The obligation to establish a key escrow system or key recovery procedure for strong encryption products  is  another  approach.2275 Implementing  such  regulations  would  enable  users  to  continue  to  use  strong  encryption technology but enable investigators to gain access to the relevant data by forcing the user to  submit the key to a special authority which holds the key and provides it to investigators if necessary.2276  Opponents of such a solution fear that people could obtain access to the submitted keys and with them  decrypt  secret  information.
In  addition,  offenders  could  relatively  easily  circumvent  the  regulation  by  developing  their  own  encryption  software  that  does  not  require  the  submission  of  the  key  to  the  authority.
Lastly, countries try to address the challenge by implementing a production order.2277 This term describes  the  obligation  to  disclose  a  key  used  to  encrypt  data.
The  implementation  of  such  an  instrument  was  discussed  within  the  1997  G8  Meeting  in  Denver.2278 A  number  of  countries  have  implemented  such  obligations.2279 An example of national implementation is section 69 of India’s Information Technology Act  2000.2280 Another  example  of  such  an  obligation  is  section 49  of  the  United  Kingdom  Regulation  of  Investigatory Powers Act 2000:2281     Notices requiring disclosure  49.
(1) This section applies where any protected information -     (a) has come into the possession of any person by means of the exercise of a statutory power to  seize, detain, inspect, search or otherwise to interfere with documents or other property, or is likely  to do so;   (b) has come into the possession of any person by means of the exercise of any statutory power to  intercept communications, or is likely to do so;   (c) has come into the possession of any person by means of the exercise of any power conferred by  an authorisation under section 22(3) or under Part II, or as a result of the giving of a notice under  section 22(4), or is likely to do so;             261   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response   (d) has come into the possession of any person as a result of having been provided or disclosed in  pursuance  of  any  statutory  duty  (whether  or  not  one  arising  as  a  result  of  a  request  for  information), or is likely to do so; or   (e) has, by any other lawful means not involving  the exercise of statutory powers, come into the  possession of any of the intelligence services, the police or the customs and excise, or is likely so to  come into the possession of any of those services, the police or the customs and excise.
(a) that a key to the protected information is in the possession of any person,   (b) that the imposition of a disclosure requirement in respect of the protected information is –    (2) If any person with the appropriate permission under Schedule 2 believes, on reasonable grounds-            (i) necessary on grounds falling within subsection (3), or   (ii) necessary for the purpose of securing the effective exercise or proper performance by any  public authority of any statutory power or statutory duty,    (c) that the imposition of such a requirement is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by  its imposition, and   (d) that it is not reasonably practicable for the person with the appropriate permission to obtain  possession of the protected information in an intelligible form without the giving of a notice under  this section,                   (a) in the interests of national security;   (b) for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime; or   (c) in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom.
the person with that permission may, by notice to the person whom he believes to have possession of the  key, impose a disclosure requirement in respect of the protected information.
(3) A disclosure requirement in respect of any protected information is necessary on grounds falling within  this subsection if it is necessary-         (4) A notice under this section imposing a disclosure requirement in respect of any protected information-   (a) must be given in writing or (if not in writing) must be given in a manner that produces a record    of its having been given;   (b) must describe the protected information to which the notice relates;   (c) must specify the matters falling within subsection (2)(b)(i) or (ii) by reference to which the notice  is given;   (d) must specify the office, rank or position held by the person giving it;   (e)  must  specify  the  office,  rank  or  position  of  the  person  who  for  the  purposes  of  Schedule  2  granted permission for the giving of the notice or (if the person giving the notice was entitled to  give  it  without  another  person’s  permission)  must  set  out  the  circumstances  in  which  that  entitlement arose;   (f) must specify the time by which the notice is to be complied with; and   (g) must set out the disclosure that is required by the notice and the form and manner in which it is  to be made;    and  the  time  specified  for  the  purposes  of  paragraph  (f)  must  allow  a  period  for  compliance  which  is  reasonable in all the circumstances.
53(1) A person to whom a section 49 notice has been given is guilty of an offence if he knowingly fails, in  accordance with the notice, to make the disclosure required by virtue of the giving of the notice.
(2) In proceedings against any person for an offence under this section, if it is shown that that person was  in possession of a key to any protected information at any time before the time of the giving of the section  49 notice, that person shall be taken for the purposes  of those proceedings to have continued to be in  possession of that key at all subsequent times, unless it is shown that the key was not in his possession  after the giving of the notice and before the time by which he was required to disclose it.
262   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     (3) For the purposes of this section a person shall be taken to have shown that he was not in possession of  a key to protected information at a particular time if-       (4) In proceedings against any person for an offence under this section it shall be a defence for that person  to show      (a) sufficient evidence of that fact is adduced to raise an issue with respect to it; and   (b) the contrary is not proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
(a) that it was not reasonably practicable for him to make the disclosure required by virtue of the  giving of the section 49 notice before the time by which he was required, in accordance with that  notice, to make it; but   (b) that he did make that disclosure as soon after that time as it was reasonably practicable for him  to do so.
[...]    The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 obliges the suspect of a crime to support the work of  law-enforcement agencies.2282   A general concern to this regulation is that the obligation leads to potential conflict with the fundamental  rights  of  a  suspect  against  self-incrimination.2283 Instead  of  leaving  the  investigation  to  the  competent  authorities,  the  suspect  has  to  actively  support  the  investigation.
Although the criminalization  requires that the offender knowingly refuses to disclose the key, losing the key could involve people using  encryption  keys  in  unwanted  criminal  proceedings.
One  example  of  how  the  offender  can  circumvent  the  obligation  is  the  use  of  encryption software based on the “plausible deniability2286” principle.2287    6.5.12  Remote forensic software  As explained above, the search for evidence on the suspect’s computer requires physical access to the  relevant hardware (computer system and external storage media).
This procedure in general implies the  need to access the apartment, house or office of the suspect.
In this case, the suspect will be aware of an  ongoing investigation as soon as the investigators start carrying out the search.2288 This information could  lead to a change in behaviour.
To avoid the detection of ongoing investigations, law-enforcement agencies demand an instrument that  allows them to access computer data stored on the suspect’s computers, and that can be secretly used  like  telephone  surveillance  for  monitoring  telephone  calls.2290 Such  an  instrument  would  enable  law- enforcement agencies to remotely access the suspect’s computer and search for information.
Currently,  the question whether or not such instruments are necessary is being intensively discussed.2291 Already in  2001, reports pointed out that the United States FBI was developing a keylogger tool for Internet-related  investigations  called  the  “magic  lantern”.2292 In  2007,  reports  were  published  that  law-enforcement  agencies in the United States were using software to trace back suspects that use means of anonymous      263   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     communication.2293 The reports were referring to a search warrant where the use of a tool called CIPAV2294  was requested.2295 After the Federal Court in Germany decided that the existing Criminal Procedural Law  provisions  do  not  allow  investigators  to  use  remote  forensic  software  to  secretly  search  the  suspect’s  computer, a debate about the need to amend the existing laws in this area started.2296Within the debate,  information was published that investigation authorities had unlawfully used remote forensic software in  a couple of investigations.2297   Various  concepts  of  “remote  forensic  software”  and  especially  its  possible  functions  have  been  discussed.2298 Seen  from  a  theoretical  perspective  the  software  could  have  the  following  functions:  one  function could be a search function.
This function would enable law-enforcement agencies to search for  illegal  content  and  collect  information  about  the  files  stored  on the  computer.2299 Another  possibility  is  recording.
If the  remote forensic software contains a module to record key strokes, this module could be used to record  passwords that the suspect uses to encrypt files.2301 Furthermore, such a tool could include identification  functions that enable the investigators to prove the suspect’s participation in a criminal offence, even if  he/she  used  anonymous  communication  services  that  make  it  difficult  for  investigators  to  identify  the  offender  by  tracing  back  the  IP-address  used.2302 Finally,  remote  software  could  be  used  to  activate  a  webcam or the microphone for room-observation purposes.2303   Although the possible functions of the software seem to be very useful for investigators, it is important to  point  out  that  there  are  a  number  of  legal  as  well  as  technical  difficulties  related  to  the  use  of  such  software.
The spread of malicious software  proves  that  the  installation  of  software  on  the  computer  of  an  Internet  user  without  his  permission  is  possible.
For example: installation with physical access to the computer system; placing  the software on a website for download; online access to the computer system by circumventing security  measures;  and  hiding  the  software  in  the  data  stream  that  is  generated  during  Internet  activities,  to  mention  just  a  few.2304 Due  to  protection  measures  such  as  virus  scanners  and  firewalls  that  most  computers are equipped with, all remote installation methods present difficulties for investigators.2305    Advantage of physical access  A number of the analyses conducted (e.g.
physical inspection of data processing media) require access to  the hardware.
In addition, remote forensic software would only enable investigators to analyse computer  systems that are connected to the Internet.2306 Furthermore, working remotely, it is difficult to maintain  the integrity of the suspect’s computer system.2307 With regard to these aspects, remote forensic software  will in general not be able to replace physical examination of the suspect’s computer system.
In  addition,  a  number  of  legal  aspects  need  to  be  taken  into  consideration  before  implementing  a  provision that enables investigators to install remote forensic software.
264   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     Example  One approach can be found in the legislative text developed by the beneficiary states within the HIPCAR  initiative.2309     Forensic Software   27.
(1)  If  a  [judge]  [magistrate]  is  satisfied  on  the  basis  of  [information  on  oath/affidavit]  that  in  an  investigation concerning an offence listed in paragraph 7 herein below there are reasonable grounds to  believe that essential evidence can not be collected by applying other instruments listed in Part IV but is  reasonably required for the purposes of a criminal investigation, the [judge] [magistrate] [may] [shall] on  application authorize a police officer to utilize a remote forensic software with the specific task required  for  the  investigation  and  install  it  on  the  suspect’s  computer  system  in  order  to  collect  the  relevant  evidence.
The application needs to contain the following information:           (2) Within such investigation it is necessary to ensure that modifications to the computer system of the  suspect are limited to those essential for the investigation and that any changes if possible can be undone  after the end of the investigation.
During the investigation it is necessary to log        (a) suspect of the offence, if possible with name and address, and  (b) description of the targeted computer system, and  (c) description of the intended measure, extent and duration of the utilization, and  (d) reasons for the necessity of the utilization.
(c) any information obtained.
Information  obtained  by  the  use  of  such  software  need  to  be  protected  again  any  modification,  unauthorized deletion and unauthorized access.
(4) The authorization to install the software includes remotely accessing the suspects computer system.
(5) If the installation process requires physical access to a place the requirements of section 20 need to be  fulfilled.
(6)  If  necessary  a  [law  enforcement]  [police]  officer  may  pursuant  to  the  order  of  court  granted  in  (1)  above request that the court order an internet service provider to support the installation process.
(7) [List of offences]  (8) A country may decide not to implement section 27.
The  drafters  of  the  legislative  text  pointed  out  that  they  are  aware  that  application  of  the  instrument  could  be  very  intrusive  and  potentially  interfere  with  fundamental  rights  of  the  suspect.2310 Several  safeguards  have  therefore  been  implemented.
Firstly,  the  use  of  such  software  requires  that  evidence  cannot be collected by means of other processes.
Secondly, an order by a judge or magistrate is required.
6.5.13  Authorization requirement  Offenders  can  take  certain  measures  to  complicate  investigations.
In  addition  to  using  software  that  enables  anonymous  communication,2311 identification  can  be  complicated  if  the  suspect  is  using  public  Internet  terminals  or  open  wireless  networks.
Restrictions  on  the  production  of  software  enabling  the  user to hide his/her identity and on making public Internet access terminals available that do not require  identification  could  help  law-enforcement  agencies  to  conduct  investigations  more  efficiently.
2314 This provision  forces anybody who intends to offer public Internet access (e.g.
Internet cafes or universities2315) to apply  for  authorization.
In  addition,  the  person  in  question  is  obliged  to  request  identification  from  his/her      265   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     customers prior to giving them access to use the service.
Since a private person who sets up a wireless  access point is in general not covered by this obligation, monitoring can quite easily be circumvented if  offenders make use of unprotected private networks to hide their identity.2316   It is questionable whether the extent of improvement in investigations justifies the restriction of access to  the Internet and to anonymous communication services.
Free access to the Internet is today recognized  as an important aspect of the right of free access to information that is protected by the constitution in a  number  of  countries.
Registration  obligation  can  interfere  with  the  right  to  operate  Internet  services  without  authorization,  as  emphasized  by  the  2005  Joint  Declaration  of  the  UN  Special  Rapporteur  on  Freedom  of  Opinion  and  Expression,  the  OSCE  Representative  on  Freedom  of  the  Media  and  the  OAS  Special  Rapporteur  on  Freedom  of  Expression.2317 It  is  likely  that  the  requirement  for  identification  will  affect the use of the Internet, insofar as users will then always have to fear that their Internet usage is  monitored.
They  can,  for  example,  use  prepaid  phonecards  bought  abroad  which  do  not  require identification to access the Internet.
There is an  ongoing debate on whether similar instruments discussed with regard to encryption technology should be  applied  to  anonymous  communication  technology  and  services.2319 Apart  from  the  conflict  between  protecting  privacy  and  ensuring  the  ability  to  investigate  offences,  the  arguments  against  the  practicability  of  the  various  legal  approaches  to  address  the  challenge  of  encryption  (especially  lack  of  enforceability) apply equally to anonymous communication.

As  there  is  no  comprehensive  international  legal  framework  and  no  supranational  body  able  to  investigate  such  offences,  transnational  crimes  require  cooperation of authorities in the countries involved.2322 The mobility of offenders, the independence from  presence  of  the  offender  and  the  impact  of  the  offence  make  it  necessary  for  law-enforcement  and  judicial authorities to collaborate and assist the state that has assumed jurisdiction.2323 Due to differences  in national law and limited instruments, international cooperation is considered to be one of the major  challenges of a globalization of crime.2324 This is relevant for traditional forms of transnational crimes as  well as cybercrime.
One of the key demands of investigators in transnational investigations is immediate  reaction of their counterparts in the country where the offender is located.2325 Especially when it comes to  this issue, traditional instruments of international judicial cooperation in criminal law matters very often  do not meet requirements in terms of the speed of investigations in the Internet.2326    6.6.2  Mechanisms for international cooperation   For cybercrime investigations, the most relevant formal mechanisms supporting international cooperation  are mutual legal assistance and extradition.
Other mechanisms such as transfer of prisoners, transfer of  proceedings in criminal matters, confiscation of criminal proceeds and asset recovery are less important in  practice.
In addition to the formal mechanisms, there are informal ways of cooperation such as exchange  of intelligence among law-enforcement agencies in different countries.
6.6.3  Overview of applicable instruments  There are three main scenarios when it comes to identifying the applicable instrument for international  cooperation.
First,  relevant  procedures  can  be  part  of  international  agreements,  such  as  the  United  Nations  Convention  against  Transnational  Organized  Crime  (UNTOC)2327 and  its  three  protocols,2328 or  regional conventions, such as the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters,2329  the  European  Convention  on  Mutual  Assistance  in  Criminal  Matters2330 and  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime.2331 The  second  possibility  is  for  procedures  to  be  regulated  by  bilateral  agreements.
Such agreements in general refer to specific requests that can be submitted and define the  relevant  procedures  and  forms  of  contact  as  well  as  the  rights  and  obligations  of  the  requesting  and  requested  states.2332 Australia,  for  example,  has  signed  more  than  30  bilateral  agreements  with  other  countries regulating aspects of extradition.2333 Some negotiations of such agreements have also addressed  cybercrime  as  a  topic,  but  it  is  uncertain  to  what  extent  the  existing  agreements  adequately  govern  cybercrime.2334 If neither a multilateral nor a bilateral agreement is applicable, international cooperation  generally needs to be founded on international courtesy, based on reciprocity.2335 As cooperation based  on bilateral agreements and courtesy very much depends on the circumstances of the actual case and the  countries involved, the following overview focuses on international and regional conventions.
6.6.4  United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime  The  main  international  instrument  for  judicial  cooperation  in  criminal  matters  is  the  United  Nations  Convention  against  Transnational  Organized  Crime  (UNTOC).2336 This  convention  contains  important  instruments  for  international  cooperation,  but  was  not  specifically  designed  to  address  cybercrime- related issues.
Application of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime  Based  on  Article 3,  paragraph  1,  the  convention  is  only  applicable  in  cybercrime  cases  if  the  offence  involves an organized crime group.
Article 2 of UNTOC defines an organized crime group as a structured  group of three or more people.
Use of terms  For the purposes of this Convention:     (a) “Organized criminal group” shall mean a structured group of three or more persons, existing for  a period of time and acting in concert with the aim of committing one or more serious crimes or  offences established in accordance with this Convention, in order to obtain, directly or indirectly, a  financial or other material benefit;   [...]    Article 3.
This  Convention  shall  apply,  except  as  otherwise  stated  herein,  to  the  prevention,  investigation  and  prosecution of:       (a) The offences established in accordance with articles 5, 6, 8 and 23 of this Convention; and  (b) Serious crime as defined in article 2 of this Convention; where the offence is transnational in  nature and involves an organized criminal group.
The convention is therefore particularly relevant for cases involving forms of  organized crime.
Without  doubt, organized crime is involved in cybercrime.
As a matter of fact, the  determination of involvement of organized crime is highly relevant.
However, analysing the link between  identity-related crime and organized crime presents difficulties.
Unlike the technical aspects of offences, the organized crime  component of offences is less intensively analysed.
However,  the  structure  of  those  groups  is  not  necessarily  comparable to that of traditional organized crime groups.
Cybercrime groups tend to have a looser and  more flexible structure.2337 In addition, groups are often much smaller compared to traditional organized  crime  groups.2338 The  Internet  enables  close  cooperation  with  others  and  coordination  of  activities  without ever having met face-to-face.
2339 This makes it feasible for offenders to work together in fluid ad  hoc groups.2340.
States Parties shall afford one another the widest measure of mutual legal assistance in investigations,  prosecutions and judicial proceedings in relation to the offences covered by this Convention as provided for  in article 3 and shall reciprocally extend to one another similar assistance where the requesting State Party  has  reasonable  grounds  to  suspect  that  the  offence  referred  to  in  article  3,  paragraph  1  (a)  or  (b),  is  transnational in nature, including that vic-tims, witnesses, proceeds, instrumentalities or evidence of such  offences  are  located  in  the  requested  State  Party  and  that  the  offence  involves  an  organized  criminal  group.
[...]    Article 18  (1)-(2)  contains  general  principles  for  international  cooperation.2341 They  are  relevant  for  cybercrime  investigation  as  well  as  traditional  investigation.
Mutual legal assistance to be afforded in accordance with this article may be requested for any of the  following purposes:               (a) Taking evidence or statements from persons;   (b) Effecting service of judicial documents;   (c)Executing searches and seizures, and freezing;   (d) Examining objects and sites;  (e) Providing information, evidentiary items and expert evaluations;   (f) Providing originals or certified copies of relevant documents and records, including government,  bank, financial, corporate or business records;  (g)  Identifying  or  tracing  proceeds  of  crime,  property,  instrumentalities  or  other  things  for  evidentiary purposes;  (h) Facilitating the voluntary appearance of persons in the requesting State Party;  (i)  Any  other  type  of  assistance  that  is  not  contrary  to  the  domestic  law  of  the  requested  State  Party.
Without  prejudice  to  domestic  law,  the  competent  authorities  of  a  State  Party  may,  without  prior  request, transmit information relating to criminal matters to a competent authority in another State Party  where  they  believe  that  such  information  could  assist  the  authority  in  undertaking  or  successfully  concluding inquiries and criminal proceedings or could result in a request formulated by the latter State  Party pursuant to this Convention.
The transmission of information pursuant to paragraph 4 of this article shall be without prejudice to  inquiries and criminal proceedings in the State of the competent authorities providing the information.
The  competent authorities receiving the information shall comply with a request that said information remain  confidential, even temporarily, or with restrictions on its use.
However, this shall not prevent the receiving  State Party from disclosing in its proceedings information that is exculpatory to an accused person.
If,  in  an  exceptional  case,  advance  notice  is  not  possible, the receiving State Party shall inform the transmitting State Party of the disclosure without delay.
It stipulates a form of cooperation2342 which takes place  on  a  voluntary  basis,  without  the  need  for  the  receiving  party  to  submit  a  mutual  legal  assistance  request.2343 It  covers  information  relating  to  criminal  matters,  such  as  information  about  potential  consumers  of  child  pornography  located  in  another  country  that  has  been  discovered  during  an  investigation.
However, information-sharing will only be able to work as a substitute if the state  receiving  the  information  is  able  to  collect  all  relevant  evidence  on  its  own.
In  all  other  cases,  formal  cooperation is usually required in any event in order to ensure the chain of custody.
In the debate on      269   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     shifting  international  cooperation  from  formal  requests  to  spontaneous  information  sharing,  it  is  necessary to keep in mind that the formal process was developed to protect the integrity of a state as well  the rights of the accused.
Sharing of information should therefore not circumvent the dogmatic structure  of mutual legal assistance.
A  person  who  is  being  detained  or  is  serving  a  sentence  in  the  territory  of  one  State  Party  whose  presence  in  another  State  Party  is  requested  for  purposes  of  identification,  testimony  or  otherwise  providing assistance in ob-taining evidence for investigations, prosecutions or judicial proceedings in rela- tion to offences covered by this Convention may be transferred if the following conditions are met:       (a) The person freely gives his or her informed consent;   (b)  The  competent  authorities  of  both  States  Parties  agree,  subject  to  such  conditions  as  those  States Parties may deem appropriate.
11.For the purposes of paragraph 10 of this article:     (a)  The  State Party  to  which  the  person is  transferred  shall  have  the  authority  and  obligation  to  keep  the  person  transferred  in  custody,  unless  other-  wise  requested  or  authorized  by  the  State  Party from which the person was transferred;  (b) The State Party to which the person is transferred shall without delay implement its obligation to  return  the  person  to  the  custody  of  the  State  Party  from  which  the  person  was  transferred  as  agreed beforehand, or as otherwise agreed, by the competent authorities of both States Parties;  (c) The State Party to which the person is transferred shall not require the State Party from which  the person was transferred to initiate extradition pro-ceedings for the return of the person;  (d) The person transferred shall receive credit for service of the sentence being served in the State  from which he or she was transferred for time spent in the custody of the State Party to which he or  she was transferred.
By mid-2010, only 30 countries had  ratified this instrument and set corresponding minimum standards with regard to cybercrime offences.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations shall be notified of the central authority  designated for this purpose at the time each State Party deposits its instrument of ratification, acceptance  or  approval  of  or  accession  to  this  Convention.
This  requirement  shall  be  without  prejudice  to  the  right  of  a  State  Party  to  require  that  such  requests  and  communications  be  addressed  to  in  urgent  circumstances, where the States Parties agree, through the International Criminal Police Organization, if  possible.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations shall be notified of the language or  languages acceptable to each State Party at the time it deposits its instrument of ratification, acceptance  or approval of or accession to this Convention.
A request for mutual legal assistance shall contain:       it  through  diplomatic  channels  and,         (a) The identity of the authority making the request;  (b) The subject matter and nature of the investigation, prosecution or judicial proceeding to which  the  request  relates  and  the  name  and  functions  of  the  authority  conducting  the  investigation,  prosecution or judicial proceeding;  (c)  A  summary  of  the  relevant  facts,  except  in  relation  to  requests  for  the  purpose  of  service  of  judicial documents;  (d)  A  description  of  the  assistance  sought  and  details  of  any  particular  procedure  that  the  requesting State Party wishes to be followed;  (e)Where possible, the identity, location and nationality of any person concerned; and  (f) The purpose for which the evidence, information or action is sought.
The  requested  State  Party  may  request  additional  information  when  it  appears  necessary  for  the  execution of the request in accordance with its domestic law or when it can facilitate such execution.
The Convention leaves it up to states whether to require the transmittal through  diplomatic channels.
This latter option being a lengthy process, such a procedure would dramatically slow  down  transmission  and  especially  hinder  expedited  measures  such  as  the  preservation  of  traffic  data.
If  states  agree,  the  International  Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) can be used as a channel for communication.
In order to facilitate  identification of the relevant authority in another country, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes  (UNODC)  maintains  an  online  directory.2346 It  provides  the  issuing  authority  with  details  of  the  central  authority of the requested state, the channels of communication and other relevant information.2347      271   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     When  submitting  the  request,  it  is  necessary  to  meet  the  formal  requirements  as  defined  by  paragraphs 14  and 15.
The  reports  of  the  State  Parties  concerning  application  of  the  Convention  show  that  while  many  states  have  legislation  requiring  MLA  requests  to  be  made  in  writing,  only  a  handful  of  countries  have  admitted  temporary  advance  requests  forwarded  by  e-mail.2348 In  this  respect,  UNTOC  differs from the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, which encourages states to use means of  electronic communication in urgent cases.2349 UNODC provides a software for drafting such requests with  the aim of ensuring that requests are complete (Mutual Legal Assistance Request Writer Tool).2350    Article 18.
The  requesting  State  Party  shall  not  transmit  or  use  information  or  evidence  furnished  by  the  requested State Party for investigations, prosecutions or judicial proceedings other than those stated in  the request without the prior consent of the requested State Party.
Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent  the requesting State Party from disclosing in its proceedings information or evi-dence that is exculpatory  to an accused person.
If, in an exceptional  case, advance notice is not possible, the requesting State Party shall inform the requested State Party of  the disclosure without delay.
The requesting State Party may require that the requested State Party keep confidential the fact and  substance of the request, except to the extent necessary to execute the request.
If the requested State  Party cannot comply with the requirement of confidentiality, it shall promptly inform the requesting State  Party.
Mutual legal assistance may be refused:       (a) If the request is not made in conformity with the provisions of this article;  (b)  If  the  requested  State  Party  considers  that  execution  of  the  request  is  likely  to  prejudice  its  sovereignty, security, ordre public or other essential interests;  (c)  If  the  authorities  of  the  requested  State  Party  would  be  prohibited  by  its  domestic  law  from  carrying  out  the  action  requested  with  regard  to  any  similar  offence,  had  it  been  subject  to  investigation, prosecution or judicial proceedings under their own jurisdiction;  (d) If it would be contrary to the legal system of the requested State Party relating to mutual legal  assistance for the request to be granted.
The  requesting  State  Party shall promptly inform the requested State Party when the assistance sought is no longer required.
Such safe conduct shall cease when the witness, expert or other person having had,  for a period of fifteen consecutive days or for any period agreed upon by the States Parties from the date  on which he or she has been officially informed that his or her presence is no longer required by the judicial  authorities,  an  opportunity  of  leaving,  has  nevertheless  remained  voluntarily  in  the  territory  of  the  requesting State Party or, having left it, has returned of his or her own free will.
If expenses of a substantial or extraordinary nature are  or will be required to fulfil the request, the States Parties shall consult to determine the terms and condi- tions under which the request will be executed, as well as the manner in which the costs shall be borne.
The requested State Party:     (a)  Shall  provide  to  the  requesting  State  Party  copies  of  government  records,  documents  or  information in its possession that under its domestic law are available to the general public;  (b) May, at its discretion, provide to the requesting State Party in whole, in part or subject to such  conditions as it deems appropriate, copies of any government records, documents or information in  its possession that under its domestic law are not available to the general public.
States Parties shall consider, as may be necessary, the possibility of concluding bilateral or multilateral  agreements  or  arrangements  that  would  serve  the  purposes  of,  give  practical  effect  to  or  enhance  the  provisions of this article.
Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime   6.6.5  The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  (the  “Convention  on  Cybercrime”)  addresses  the  increasing importance of international cooperation in Articles 23 to 35.
General Principles for International Cooperation   Article 23 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime defines three general principles regarding  international cooperation in cybercrime investigations among members.
Article 23 – General principles relating to international co-operation   The  Parties  shall  co-operate  with  each  other,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  this  chapter,  and  through  the  application  of  relevant  international  instruments  on  international  co-operation  in  criminal  matters, arrangements agreed on the basis of uniform or reciprocal legislation, and domestic laws, to the  widest  extent  possible  for  the  purposes  of  investigations  or  proceedings  concerning  criminal  offences  related to computer systems and data, or for the collection of evidence in electronic form of a criminal  offence.
First  of  all,  members  are  supposed  to  provide  cooperation  in  international  investigation  to  the  widest  extent  possible.
This  obligation  reflects  the  importance  of  international  cooperation  in  cybercrime  investigations.
If the suspect in a murder  case has used an e-mail service abroad, Article 23 would be applicable with regard investigations that are      273   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     necessary in regard to data stored by the host provider.2351 The third principle notes that the provisions  dealing  with  international  cooperation  do  not  substitute  provisions  of  international  agreements  pertaining to mutual legal assistance and extradition or relevant provisions of domestic law pertaining to  international  cooperation.
Therefore, only in those cases where the existing  treaties, laws and arrangements do not already contain such provisions, each Party is required to establish  a  legal  basis  to  enable  the  carrying  out  of  international  cooperation  as  defined  by  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime.2352    Extradition  The  extradition  of  nationals  remains  one  of  the  most  difficult  aspects  of  international  cooperation.2353  Requests for extradition very often lead to conflict between the need to protect the citizen and the need  to support an ongoing investigation in a country abroad.
Where  a  different  minimum  penalty  is  to  be  applied  under  an  arrangement  agreed  on  the  basis  of  uniform or reciprocal legislation or an extradition treaty, including the European Convention on Extradition  (ETS  No.
The  criminal  offences  described  in  paragraph  1  of  this  article  shall  be  deemed  to  be  included  as  extraditable  offences  in  any  extradition  treaty  existing  between  or  among  the  Parties.
The  Parties  undertake  to  include  such  offences  as  extraditable  offences  in  any  extradition  treaty  to  be  concluded  between or among them.
Extradition  shall  be  subject  to  the  conditions  provided  for  by  the  law  of  the  requested  Party  or  by  applicable extradition treaties, including the grounds on which the requested Party may refuse extradition.
Each Party shall, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance,  approval  or  accession,  communicate  to  the  Secretary  General  of  the  Council  of  Europe  the  name  and  address of each authority responsible for making or receiving requests for extradition or provisional arrest  in the absence of a treaty.
One of the  most  important  regulations  in  Article 25  is  paragraph 3,  which  highlights  the  importance  of  fast  communication  in  cybercrime  investigations.2356 As  pointed  out  previously,  a  number  of  cybercrime  investigations at the national level fail because the investigations take too long and important data are  therefore  deleted  before  procedural  measures  to  preserve  them  are  undertaken.2357 Investigations  that  require mutual legal assistance usually take even longer, due to the time-consuming formal requirements  in  the  communications  of  law-enforcement  agencies.
Each Party shall also adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to carry out the  obligations set forth in Articles 27 through 35.
Each  Party  may,  in  urgent  circumstances,  make  requests  for  mutual  assistance  or  communications  related  thereto  by  expedited  means  of  communication,  including  fax  or  e-mail,  to  the  extent  that  such  means provide appropriate levels of security and authentication (including the use of encryption, where  necessary),  with  formal  confirmation  to  follow,  where  required  by  the  requested  Party.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in articles in this chapter, mutual assistance shall be subject to  the conditions provided for by the law of the requested Party or by applicable mutual assistance treaties,  including the grounds on which the requested Party may refuse co-operation.
If  law-enforcement  agencies,  for  example,  investigate  a  child- pornography  case,  they  may  find  information  about  paedophiles  from  other  countries  who  have  participated  in  the  exchange  of  child  pornography.2359 Article 26  sets  out  the  regulations  that  are  necessary for law-enforcement agencies to inform foreign law-enforcement agencies without jeopardizing  their own investigation.2360     Article 26 – Spontaneous information  1.
A Party may, within the limits of its domestic law and without prior request, forward to another Party  information obtained within the framework of its own investigations when it considers that the disclosure  of  such  information  might  assist  the  receiving  Party  in  initiating  or  carrying  out  investigations  or  proceedings concerning criminal offences established in accordance with this Convention or might lead to  a request for co-operation by that Party under this chapter.
Prior to providing such information, the providing Party may request that it be kept confidential or only  used  subject  to  conditions.
If  the  receiving  Party  cannot  comply  with  such  request,  it  shall  notify  the  providing Party, which shall then determine whether the information should nevertheless be provided.
If  the receiving Party accepts the information subject to the conditions, it shall be bound by them.
As pointed out above, there are certain concerns related to the replacement of mutual legal assistance by  spontaneous  information.
Information  sharing  will  only  be  able  to  work  if  the  state  receiving  the  information is able to collect all relevant evidence on its own.
In all other cases, formal cooperation is  usually  required  in  any  event  in  order  to  ensure  the  chain  of  custody.
In  the  debate  on  shifting  international  cooperation  from  formal  requests  to  spontaneous  information  sharing,  it  is  necessary  to  keep in mind that the formal process was developed to protect the integrity of a state as well the rights of  the accused.
Sharing of information should therefore not circumvent the dogmatic structure of mutual  legal assistance.
One of the most important regulations of Article 26 relates to the confidentiality of information.
Given  that a number of investigations can only be carried out successfully if the offender is not aware of the  investigations  taking  place,  Article 26  enables  the  providing  party  to  request  confidentiality  for  the  information  transmitted.
If  the  confidentiality  cannot  be  granted,  the  providing  party  can  refuse  the  information process.
Procedures  pertaining  to  mutual  assistance  requests  in  the  absence  of  applicable  international  agreements  Like Article 25, Article 27 is based on the idea that mutual legal assistance should be carried out through  application of relevant treaties and similar arrangements instead of solely referring to the Convention on  Cybercrime.
The  most  important  aspects  regulated  by  Article 27  include  the  obligation  to  establish  a  designated  contact point for mutual legal assistance requests2362, requirements of direct communication between the  contact  points  to  avoid  lengthy  procedures2363 and  creation  of  a  database  of  all  contact  points  by  the  Secretary General of the Council of Europe.
Parties to the Convention  on Cybercrime can especially refuse cooperation with regard to political offences or if it considers that the  cooperation could prejudice its sovereignty, security, public order or other essential interests.
The  Explanatory  Report  to  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  points  out  that  this  could  be  the  case  if  the  cooperation  could  lead  to  fundamental  difficulties  for  the  requested  party.2365 From  the  drafters’  perspective,  concerns  related  to  inadequate  data-protection  laws  are  not  considered  to  be  essential  interests.2366    Mutual assistance regarding provisional measures  Arts.
Procedural Instrument   Corresponding ML provision   Article 16 – Expedited preservation of stored computer data2371  Article 17 – Expedited preservation and partial disclosure of traffic data2372  Article 18 – Production order2373  Article 19 – Search and seizure of stored computer data2374  Article 20 – Real-time collection of traffic data2375  Article 21 – Interception of content data2376   Article 29  Article 30   None   Article 31   Article 33   Article 34   Transborder access to stored computer data  In  addition  to  purely  mirroring  procedural  provisions,  the  drafters  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  discussed  under  which  circumstances  law-enforcement  agencies  are  allowed  to  access  computer  data  that are neither stored in their territory nor under the control of a person in their territory.
They were  only  able  to  agree  on  two  case  scenarios  where  an  investigation  should  be  carried  out  by  one  law- enforcement  agency  without  the  need  to  request  mutual  legal  assistance.2377 Further  agreements  were  not  possible2378 and  even  the  solution  reached  is  still  criticized  by  Member  States  of  the  Council  of  Europe.2379   The two cases where law-enforcement agencies are allowed to access data stored outside their territory  are related to:    •  publicly available information; and/or  •  access with the consent of the person in control.
Article 32 – Trans-border access to stored computer data with consent or where publicly available  A Party may, without the authorisation of another Party:     a.  access  publicly  available  (open  source)  stored  computer  data,  regardless  of  where  the  data  is  located geographically; or  b. access or receive, through a computer system in its territory, stored computer data located in  another  Party,  if  the  Party  obtains  the  lawful  and  voluntary  consent  of  the  person  who  has  the  lawful authority to disclose the data to the Party through that computer system.
Other forms of transborder access are not covered by Article 32, but nor are they precluded.2380   Article 32  notes  that  if  the  relevant  data  are  publicly  available,  foreign  law-enforcement  agencies  are  allowed  to  access  this  information.
An  example  of  publicly  available  information  is  information  made  available  on  websites  without  access  control  (such  as  passwords).
If  investigators  were  not  allowed  –  unlike any other user –to access these websites, this could seriously hinder their work.
The  second  situation  in  which  law-enforcement  agencies  are  allowed  to  access  stored  computer  data  outside their territory is when the investigators have obtained the lawful and voluntary consent of the  person who has lawful authority to disclose the data.
This authorization is heavily criticized.2381   One main concern is the fact that the provision in its current wording probably contradicts fundamental  principles  of  international  law.2382 Based  on  international  law,  investigators  have  to  respect  national  sovereignty  during  an  investigation.2383 They  are  especially  not  allowed  to  carry  out  investigations  in  another state without the consent of the competent authorities in that state.
Interestingly  enough,  such  a  restriction  was  included in the draft text of the Convention on Cybercrime presented in the beginning of 2000, but was  removed in the 22nd draft.2384   By creating Article 32 sub-paragraph b, the drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime ultimately violated  the  dogmatic  structure  of  the  mutual  legal  assistance  regime  in  this  Convention.
If  law-enforcement  agencies  were  to  be  authorized  to  use  this  instrument  in  international  investigations,  it  would  have  been  sufficient  to  include  it  in  the  catalogue  of  instruments  mentioned  in  the  context  of  mutual  legal  assistance.
However,  the  instrument  cannot  be  applied  in  international  investigations  because  the  corresponding  provision  in  Chapter 3  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime,  dealing  with  international  cooperation,  is  lacking.
Instead  of  relinquishing  the  dogmatic  structure by allowing foreign investigators to contact directly the person who has control over the data  and  ask  for  the  submission  of  the  data,  the  drafters  could  have  simply  implemented  a  corresponding  provision in Chapter 3 of the Convention.2385   Transborder  access  to  stored  computer  data  was  also  discussed  in  Moscow  at  the  1999  G8 Ministerial  Conference on Combating Transnational Organized Crimes.2386 One of the outcomes of the meeting was a  collection  of  principles  regarding  transborder  access.2387 This  was  in  all  likelihood  the  model  for  the  regulation used by the drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime, and therefore shows similarities.
Transborder Access to Stored Data not Requiring Legal Assistance  Notwithstanding anything in these Principles, a State need not obtain authorization from another State  when it is acting in accordance with its national law for the purpose of:      (a) accessing publicly available (open source) data, regardless of where the data is geographically  located   (b) accessing, searching, copying, or seizing data stored in a computer system located in another  State, if acting in accordance with the lawful and voluntary consent of a person who has the lawful  authority  to  disclose  to  it  that  data.
It would not prevent conflict with international law,  but at least guarantee a certain degree of transparency.
24/7 Network of contacts   Cybercrime investigations often require immediate reaction.2388 As explained above, this is especially the  case when it comes to the traffic data that are necessary to identify a suspect, as they are often deleted  within  a  rather  short  period  of  time.2389 To  increase  the  speed  of  international  investigations,  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  highlights  the  importance  of  enabling  the  use  of  expedited  means  of  communication in Article 25.
In order to further improve the efficiency of mutual assistance requests, the  drafters  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  oblige  the  parties  to  designate  a  contact  point  for  mutual  assistance requests, who shall be available without time limitations.2390 The drafters of the Convention on  Cybercrime  emphasized  that  establishment  of  the  points  of  contact  is  one  of  the  most  important  instruments provided by the Convention.2391 However, a recent review of the use of 24/7 network points  in countries that have ratified the Convention on Cybercrime shows that its use is very limited.
278   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response   a. the provision of technical advice;  b. the preservation of data pursuant to Articles 29 and 30;   c. the collection of evidence, the provision of legal information, and locating of suspects.
Article 35 – 24/7 Network   1.
Such  assistance  shall  include  facilitating,  or,  if  permitted  by  its  domestic law and practice, directly carrying out the following measures:        2a.
If  the  point  of  contact  designated  by  a  Party  is  not  part  of  that  Party’s  authority  or  authorities  responsible for international mutual assistance or extradition, the point of contact shall ensure that it is  able to co-ordinate with such authority or authorities on an expedited basis.
Each  Party  shall  ensure  that  trained  and  equipped  personnel  are  available,  in  order  to  facilitate  the  operation of the network.
The idea of the 24/7 Network is based on the existing network for 24-hour contacts for International High- Tech  and  Computer-related  Crime  from  the  G8  Group  of  Nations.2392 With  the  creation  of  a  network  of 24/7  contact  points,  the  drafters  of the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  aim  to  address  the  challenges  of  fighting  cybercrime  –  especially  those  associated  with  the  speed  of  data  exchange  processes2393 and  having  an  international  dimension.2394 The  parties  to  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  are  obliged  to  establish such contact points and ensure that they are able to carry out certain immediate action, as well  as maintain the service.
As stated in Article 35 paragraph 3 of the Convention, this includes trained and  equipped personnel.
The  Convention  neither  requires  the  creation  of  a  new  authority,  nor  defines  to  which  of  the  existing  authorities the contact point could or should be attached.
The drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime  further pointed out that the fact that the 24/7 network point is intended to provide technical as well as  legal assistance will lead to various possible solutions regarding its implementation.
The combination of both  functions  has  the  potential  to  converge  the  speed  of  international  investigations  to  the  level  reached  within national investigations.
Article 32 of the Convention on Cybercrime defines the minimum required abilities of the network point.
Apart from technical assistance and the provision of legal information, the main tasks of the contact point  include the preservation of data, the collection of evidence and the locating of suspects.
If  the  contact  point  is  operated by an authority that has competence to order the preservation of data,2395 and a foreign contact  point requests such preservation, the measure can immediately be ordered by the local contact point.
If  the contact point is run by an authority that is not competent to order the preservation of data itself, it is  important that the contact point shall have the ability to straight away contact the competent authorities  to ensure that the measure is carried out immediately.2396   At  the  2nd  Meeting  of  the  Cybercrime  Convention  Committee,  it  was  explicitly  pointed  out  that  the  participation  in  the  24/7  network  of  contacts  does  not  require  the  signature  or  ratification  of  the  Convention on Cybercrime.2397       279   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     In 2008, the Council of Europe published a study analysing the effectiveness of international cooperation  against cybercrime.2398 In 2009, a specific study on the functioning of 24/7 points of contact for cybercrime  was undertaken.2399 One result of the studies is that not all countries which have ratified the Convention  on Cybercrime have created functioning 24/7 network points as required by the Convention.
International Cooperation in the Stanford Draft International Convention   6.6.6  The  drafters  of  the  Stanford  Draft  International  Convention  (the  “Stanford  Draft”)2400 recognized  the  importance of the international dimension of cybercrime and the related challenges.
In order to address  these  challenges,  they  incorporated  specific  provisions  that  deal  with  international  cooperation.
As  pointed out by the drafters of the Stanford Draft, the approach of the Convention on Cybercrime is more  practical and therefore has some clear advantages in terms of actual application.2401 The drafters of the  Stanford Draft decided to follow a different approach, as they predicted that the implementation of new  technology  could  lead  to  some  difficulties.
As  a  result,  they  only  provided  some  general  instructions  without specifying them further.2402    et   seq.,   available   Public   Policy,   Volume   9,   2005,   page 15   Services,  Virginia   Journal  of   Law   and   Liability of Internet providers   Technology,  Vol.

Introduction   to   Internet   Introduction   6.7.1  Committing a cybercrime automatically involves a number of people and businesses, even if the offender  acts alone.
Due to the structure of the Internet, the transmission of a simple e-mail requires the service of  a number of providers.2403 In addition to the e-mail provider, the transmission involves access providers as  well as routers who forward the e-mail to the recipient.
The  downloading  process  involves  the  content  provider  who  uploaded the pictures (for example on a website), the hosting provider who provided the storage media  for  the  website,  the  routers  who  forwarded  the  files  to  the  user,  and  finally  the  access  provider  who  enabled the user to access the Internet.
Because of this involvement by multiple parties, Internet service providers have long since been at the  centre of criminal investigations involving offenders who use the ISPs’ services to commit an offence.2404  One of the main reasons for this development is that, even when the offender is acting from abroad, the  providers located within the country’s national borders are a suitable subject for criminal investigations  without violating the principle of national sovereignty.2405   The fact that, on the one hand, cybercrime cannot be committed without the involvement of providers,  and, on the other hand, providers often do not have the ability to prevent these crimes, has led to the  question  whether  the  responsibility  of  Internet  providers  needs  to  be  limited.2406 The  answer  to  the  question is critical for economic development of the ICT infrastructure.
The work of law-enforcement agencies  very  often  depends  on  cooperation  of,  and  with,  Internet  providers.
This  raises  some  concern,  since  limiting the liability of Internet providers for acts committed by their users could have an impact on the  ISPs’ cooperation and support for cybercrime investigations, as well as on the actual prevention of crime.
Limitations on liability relating to material online  (a) Transitory Digital Network Communications  A  service  provider  shall  not  be  liable  for  monetary  relief,  or,  except  as  provided  in  subsection  (j),  for  injunctive or other equitable relief, for infringement of copyright by reason of the provider’s transmitting,  routing, or providing connections for, material through a system or network controlled or operated by or  for  the  service  provider,  or  by  reason  of  the  intermediate  and transient  storage of  that  material  in  the  course of such transmitting, routing, or providing connections, if –              (1) the transmission of the material was initiated by or at the direction of a person other than the  service provider;  (2)  the  transmission,  routing,  provision  of  connections,  or  storage  is  carried  out  through  an  automatic technical process without selection of the material by the service provider;  (3)  the  service  provider  does  not  select  the  recipients  of  the  material  except  as  an  automatic  response to the request of another person;  (4)  no  copy  of  the  material  made  by  the  service  provider  in  the  course  of  such  intermediate  or  transient  storage  is  maintained  on  the  system  or  network  in  a  manner  ordinarily  accessible  to  anyone other than anticipated recipients, and no such copy is maintained on the system or network  in  a  manner  ordinarily  accessible  to  such  anticipated  recipients  for  a  longer  period  than  is  reasonably necessary for the transmission, routing, or provision of connections; and  (5) the material is transmitted through the system or network without modification of its content.
(b) System Caching      281   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response   (1) Limitation on liability.– A service provider shall not be liable for monetary relief, or, except as  provided in subsection (j), for injunctive or other equitable relief, for infringement of copyright by  reason of the intermediate and temporary storage of material on a system or network controlled or  operated by or for the service provider in a case in which –   (A) the material is made available online by a person other than the service provider;  (B)  the  material  is  transmitted  from  the  person  described  in  subparagraph  (A)  through  the  system  or  network  to  a  person  other  than  the  person  described  in  subparagraph  (A)  at  the  direction of that other person; and  (C) the storage is carried out through an automatic technical process for the purpose of making  the material available to users of the system or network who, after the material is transmitted  as described in subparagraph (B), request access to the material from the person described in  subparagraph (A),    if the conditions set forth in paragraph (2) are met.
[...]         This  provision  is  based  on  the  Digital  Millennium  Copyright  Act  (DMCA)  which  was  signed  into  law  in  1998.2408 By creating a safe-harbour regime, DMCA excluded the liability of providers of certain services  for copyright violations by third parties.2409 In this context, it is first of all important to highlight that not all  providers  are  covered  by  the  limitation.2410 The  limitation  of  liability  is  only  applicable  to  service  providers2411 and caching providers.2412 In addition, it is important to point out that the liability is linked to  certain requirements.
With regard to service providers, the requirements are that:    •   •   the transmission of the material was initiated by or at the direction of a person other than the  service provider;  the transmission is carried out through an automatic technical process without selection of the  material by the service provider;  the service provider does not select the recipients of the material;   •  •  no  copy  of  the  material  made  by  the  service  provider  in  the  course  of  such  intermediate  or  transient  storage  is  maintained  on  the  system  or  network  in  a  manner  ordinarily  accessible  to  anyone other than anticipated recipients.
Another  example  of  a  limitation  of  the  responsibility  of  Internet  providers  can  be  found  in  47  USC.
Protection for private blocking and screening of offensive material  [...]  (c) Protection for “Good Samaritan” blocking and screening of offensive material       (1) Treatment of publisher or speaker  No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of  any information provided by another information content provider.
(2) Civil liability  No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of –   (A) any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that  the  provider  or  user  considers  to  be  obscene,  lewd,  lascivious,  filthy,  excessively  violent,  harassing,  or  otherwise  objectionable,  whether  or  not  such  material  is  constitutionally  protected; or  (B) any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the  technical means to restrict access to material described in paragraph (1).
§ 230(c),  have  in  common  is  that  they  focus on liability with regard to special groups of providers and special areas of law.
European Union Directive on Electronic Commerce   6.7.3  An example of a legislative approach to regulate the liability of Internet providers is the European Union’s  E-Commerce Directive.2414 Faced with the challenges stemming from the international dimension of the  Internet, the drafters of the Directive decided to develop legal standards that provide a legal framework  for  the  overall  development  of  the  information  society,  and  thereby  support  overall  economic  development  as  well  as  the  work  of  law-enforcement  agencies.
However, like the routers, the big hosting providers are unable to  control all data stored on their servers.
Having regard to the varying ability to actually control criminal activities, the liability of hosting and access  providers  is  different.
In  this  respect,  it  needs  to  be  taken  into  consideration  that  the  balance  of  the  Directive  is  based  on  current  technical  standards.
If  technical  development  continues  in  this  area  it  could  become  necessary  to  evaluate  the  technical  ability  of  providers  in  the  future  and,  if  necessary,  adjust the system.
Liability of access provider (European Union Directive on Electronic Commerce)   6.7.4  Article 12  to 15  define  the  degree  of  the  limitation  of  liability  of  the  different  providers.
Based  on  Article 12, the  liability  of  access  providers  and  router  operators  is  completely  excluded  as  long  as  they  comply  with  the  three  conditions  stipulated  in  Article 12.
As  a  consequence,  the  access  provider  is  in  general not responsible for criminal offences committed by its users.
Where an information society service is provided that consists of the transmission in a communication  network  of  information  provided  by  a  recipient  of  the  service,  or  the  provision  of  access  to  a  communication  network,  Member  States  shall  ensure  that  the  service  provider  is  not  liable  for  the  information transmitted, on condition that the provider:        2.
The acts of transmission and of provision of access referred to in paragraph 1 include the automatic,  intermediate and transient storage of the information transmitted in so far as this takes place for the sole  purpose  of  carrying  out  the  transmission  in  the  communication  network,  and  provided  that  the  information is not stored for any period longer than is reasonably necessary for the transmission.
This Article shall not affect the possibility for a court or administrative authority, in accordance with  Member States’ legal systems, of requiring the service provider to terminate or prevent an infringement.
(a) does not initiate the transmission;  (b) does not select the receiver of the transmission; and  (c) does not select or modify the information contained in the transmission.
§ 512(a).2419 Both regulations aim to specify the liability of service  providers and both regulations link the limitation of liability to similar requirements.
Liability for caching (European Union Directive on Electronic Commerce)   6.7.5  The term “caching” is in this context used to describe the storage of popular websites on local storage  media in order to reduce bandwidth and make access to data more efficient.2420 One technique used to  reduce  bandwidth  is  the  installation  of  proxy  servers.2421 Within  this  scope,  a  proxy  server  may  service  requests  without  contacting  the  specified  server  (the  domain  name  entered  by  the  user)  by  retrieving  content saved on local storage media from a previous request.
One  of  the  conditions  is  that  the  provider complies with widely recognized standards regarding the updating of the information.
Where an information society service is provided that consists of the transmission in a communication  network of information provided by a recipient of the service, Member States shall ensure that the service  provider  is  not  liable  for  the  automatic,  intermediate  and  temporary  storage  of  that  information,  performed for the sole purpose of making more efficient the information’s onward transmission to other  recipients of the service upon their request, on condition that:         (a) the provider does not modify the information;  (b) the provider complies with conditions on access to the information;  (c)  the  provider  complies  with  rules  regarding  the  updating  of  the  information,  specified  in  a  manner widely recognised and used by industry;  (d) the provider does not interfere with the lawful use of technology, widely recognised and used by  industry, to obtain data on the use of the information; and  (e) the provider acts expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information it has stored  upon  obtaining  actual  knowledge  of  the  fact  that  the  information  at  the  initial  source  of  the  transmission has been removed from the network, or access to it has been disabled, or that a court  or an administrative authority has ordered such removal or disablement.
This Article shall not affect the possibility for a court or administrative authority, in accordance with  Member States’ legal systems, of requiring the service provider to terminate or prevent an infringement.
§ 512(b).2422 Both regulations aim to specify the liability of caching providers and both regulations link the  limitation of liability to similar requirements.
However, unlike in the case of the access provider, the liability of the host provider is not excluded.
Where an information society service is provided that consists of the storage of information provided by  a  recipient  of  the  service,  Member  States  shall  ensure  that  the  service  provider  is  not  liable  for  the  information stored at the request of a recipient of the service, on condition that:     (a) the provider does not have actual knowledge of illegal activity or information and, as regards  claims  for  damages,  is  not  aware  of  facts  or  circumstances  from  which  the  illegal  activity  or  information is apparent; or  (b) the provider, upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove or to  disable access to the information.
Paragraph 1 shall not apply when the recipient of the service is acting under the authority or the control  of the provider.
This Article shall not affect the possibility for a court or administrative authority, in accordance with  Member States’ legal systems, of requiring the service provider to terminate or prevent an infringement,  nor does it affect the possibility for Member States of establishing procedures governing the removal or  disabling of access to information.
Popular Internet services like the auction platforms offer hosting services, too.2427      Liability of hosting provider (HIPCAR)   6.7.7  Another approach to the liability of hosting providers can be found in the legislative text developed by the  beneficiary states within the HIPCAR initiative.2428     Hosting Provider  30 (1) A hosting provider is not criminally liable for the information stored at the request of a user of the  service, on condition that:     (a) the hosting provider expeditiously removes or disables access to the information after receiving  an order from any public authority or court of law to remove specific illegal information stored; or  (b) the hosting provider, upon obtaining knowledge or awareness about specific illegal information  stored by other ways than an order from a public authority, expeditiously informs a public authority  to enable them to evaluate the nature of the information and if necessary issue an order to remove  the content.
(2) Paragraph 1 shall not apply when the user of the service is acting under the authority or the control of  the hosting provider.
If it receives knowledge, its obligation is first of all      285   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response     limited to informing the (designated) public authority about the potentially illegal content.
The drafters of  the provision decided that it is those authorities which should determine the nature of the provision and  issue  an  order  to  remove  the  content.2430 If  the  information  is  considered  illegal  the  provider  needs  to  remove it to avoid liability.
6.7.8   Exclusion  of  the  obligation  to  monitor  (European  Union  Directive  on  Electronic  Commerce)   Before the Directive was implemented it was uncertain in some Member States whether the providers  could be prosecuted based on a violation of the obligation to monitor users’ activities.
To  avoid  these  conflicts, the Directive excludes a general obligation to monitor transmitted or stored information.
Member States shall not impose a general obligation on providers, when providing the services covered  by Articles 12, 13 and 14, to monitor the information which they transmit or store, nor a general obligation  actively to seek facts or circumstances indicating illegal activity.
Member States may establish obligations for information society service providers promptly to inform  the  competent  public  authorities  of  alleged  illegal  activities  undertaken  or  information  provided  by  recipients of their service or obligations to communicate to the competent authorities, at their request,  information  enabling  the  identification  of  recipients  of  their  service  with  whom  they  have  storage  agreements.
Liability for hyperlinks (Austrian ECC)   6.7.9  Hyperlinks play in important role on the Internet.
They enable the provider of the hyperlink to guide the  user  to  specific  information  available  online.
Instead  of  just  offering  technical  details  on  how  the  information can be accessed (e.g.
by providing the domain name of the website where the information is  offered), the user can directly access the information by clicking on the active hyperlink.
The hyperlink  provides the command for the web browser to open the deposited Internet address.
Instead, they implemented a re-examination procedure to ensure that  the need for proposals concerning the liability of providers of hyperlinks and location tool services was  taken  into  consideration.2432 Until  regulation  of  liability  for  hyperlinks  is  amended  in  the  future,  the  Member States are free to develop national solutions.2433 Some EU countries have decided to address the  liability  of  hyperlink  providers  in  a  dedicated  provision.2434 These  countries  have  based  the  liability  of  hyperlink providers on the same principles that the Directive provides with regard the liability of hosting  providers.2435 This approach is the logical consequence of the comparable situation of host and hyperlink  providers.
In  both  cases,  the  providers  are  in  control  of  the  illegal  content,  or  at  least  the  link  to  the  content.
17 ECC (Austria) – Liability for hyperlinks  (1) A provider who enables the access to information provided by third person by providing an electronic  link is not liable for the information if he     1.  does  not  have  actual  knowledge  of  unlawful  activity  or  information  and,  where  a  claim  for  damages is made, is not aware of facts or circumstances from which it would have been apparent  to the service provider that the activity or information was unlawful; or   2. upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove the electronic link.
Search engines play an import role in the successful development of the Internet.
Content that is made  available on a website but is not listed in the search engine’s index can only be accessed if the person  wishing  to  access  it  knows  the  complete  URL.
Introna/Nissenbaum  points  out  that  “without  much  exaggeration one could say that to exist is to be indexed by a search engine”.2437   As in the case of hyperlinks, the European Union Directive does not contain standards defining the liability  of search-engine operators.
14 ECC (Austria) – Liability of search engine operators   (1)  A  provider  who  makes available  a  search  engine  or  other electronic  tools  to search  for  information  provided by third party is not liable on condition that the provider:         1. does not initiate the transmission;  2. does not select the receiver of the transmission; and   3. does not select or modify the information contained in the transmission         1360 For an overview of legal approaches, see also: ITU Global Cybersecurity Agenda/High-Level Experts Group, Global   Strategic Report, 2008, page 18 et seq., available at:  www.itu.int/osg/csd/cybersecurity/gca/global_strategic_report/index.html.
1363 Four definitions are included in Art.
1 and an additional provision was included in Art.

1415 These range from the simple proof that technical protection measures can be circumvented, to the intent to obtain  data stored on the victim computer.
In addition, there are several tools available that can   be used to circumvent protection measures.
1418 Regarding the supportive aspects of missing technical protection measures, see Wilson, Computer Attacks and Cyber   Terrorism, Cybercrime & Security, IIV-3, page 5.
The importance of implementing effective security measures to prevent  illegal access is also highlighted by the drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime.
“The need for protection reflects the   interests of organizations and individuals to manage, operate and control their systems in an undisturbed and  uninhibited manner”.

The following text presents the old version:            Section 202a – Data Espionage   (1) Whoever, without authorization, obtains data for himself or another, which was not intended for him and was  specially protected against unauthorized access, shall be punished with imprisonment for not more than three years or  a fine.

1429 Regarding the system of reservations and restrictions, see Gercke, The Convention on Cybercrime, Computer Law   Review International, 2006, 144.
With regard to Internet-related social engineering techniques, see the  information offered by the anti-phishing working group, available at: www.antiphishing.org; Jakobsson, The Human  Factor in Phishing, available at: www.informatics.indiana.edu/markus/papers/aci.pdf; Gercke, Computer und Recht  2005, page 606.
The term “phishing” describes an act that is carried out to make the victim disclose personal/secret  information.
It originally described the use of e-mails to “phish” for passwords and financial data from a sea of Internet  users.
For more information on the phenomenon of phishing, see above:  § 2.9.4.
1433 The relevance of attacks by insiders is highlighted by the 2007 CSI Computer Crime and Security Survey.
Nearly  40 per cent of all respondents reported that between 1 per cent and 40 per cent of the losses related to computer and  network crimes were caused by insiders.
For more details, see: 2007 CSI Computer Crime and Security Survey, page 12,  available at: www.gocsi.com/.
1434 Reservations and restrictions are two possibilities of adjusting the requirements of the Convention to the requirements   of individual national legal systems.
The Explanatory Report notes that: “A specificity of the offences included is the express requirement that  the conduct involved is done “without right”.
Thus, without restricting how Parties may  implement the concept in their domestic law, it may refer to conduct undertaken without authority (whether legislative,  executive, administrative, judicial, contractual or consensual) or conduct that is otherwise not covered by established  legal defences, excuses, justifications or relevant principles under domestic law.
The Convention, therefore, leaves  unaffected conduct undertaken pursuant to lawful government authority (for example, where the Party’s government  acts to maintain public order, protect national security or investigate criminal offences).
Furthermore, legitimate and  common activities inherent in the design of networks, or legitimate and common operating or commercial practices  should not be criminalized”.

1446 Article 42 – Reservations: By a written notification addressed to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, any   State may, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession,  declare that it avails itself of the reservation(s) provided for in Article 4, paragraph 2, Article 6, paragraph 3, Article 9,  paragraph 4, Article 10, paragraph 3, Article 11, paragraph 3, Article 14, paragraph 3, Article 22, paragraph 2, Article 29,  paragraph 4, and Article 41, paragraph 1.
1447 This limits the criminalization of illegal access to those cases where the victim used technical protection measures to  protect its computer system.
Access an unprotected computer system would therefore not be considered a criminal  act.
1448 The additional mental element/motivation enables Member States to undertake a more focused approach rather than  implementing a criminalization of the mere act of hacking.
1449 This enables Member States to avoid a criminalization of cases where the offender had physical access to the computer   system of the victim and therefore did not need to perform an Internet-based attack.
1450 Framework Decision on Attacks against Information Systems – 19 April 2002 – COM (2002) 173.
1451   Article 2 – Illegal access to information systems:      1.
Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the intentional access without right to the  whole or any part of an information system is punishable as a criminal offence, at least for cases that are not minor.
Each Member State may decide that the conduct referred to in paragraph 1 is incriminated only where the offence  is committed by infringing a security measure.

1455 The Stanford Draft International Convention (CISAC) was developed as a follow-up to a conference hosted in Stanford   University in the United States in 1999.

The Explanatory Report notes that: “A specificity of the offences included is the express requirement that  the conduct involved is done “without right”.
Thus, without restricting how Parties may  implement the concept in their domestic law, it may refer to conduct undertaken without authority (whether legislative,  executive, administrative, judicial, contractual or consensual) or conduct that is otherwise not covered by established  legal defences, excuses, justifications or relevant principles under domestic law.
The Convention, therefore, leaves  unaffected conduct undertaken pursuant to lawful government authority (for example, where the Party’s government  acts to maintain public order, protect national security or investigate criminal offences).
Furthermore, legitimate and  common activities inherent in the design of networks, or legitimate and common operating or commercial practices  should not be criminalized”.

1469 One of the consequences related to this aspect is the fact that limitation of the criminalization of illegal access to those  cases where the victim of the attack secured the target computer system with technical protection measures could limit  the application of such a provision, insofar as a large number of users do not have sufficient knowledge about the  implementation of technical protection measures.

1478 This provision has recently been modified and now even criminalizes illegal access to data.
1480 A similar approach of limiting criminalization to cases where the victim did not take preventive measures can be found   in Art.
2, sentence 2, Convention on Cybercrime: A Party may require that the offence be committed by infringing  security measures, with the intent of obtaining computer data or other dishonest intent, or in relation to a computer  system that is connected to another computer system.
For more information, see above: § 6.1.1.
1481 This provision is therefore an example for of a legislative approach that should not substitute for, but rather   complement, self-protection measures.

1495 The Explanatory Report describes the technical means more in detail: “Interception by ‘technical means’ relates to   listening to, monitoring or surveillance of the content of communications, to the procuring of the content of data either  directly, through access and use of the computer system, or indirectly, through the use of electronic eavesdropping or  tapping devices.
Technical means includes technical devices fixed to  transmission lines as well as devices to collect and record wireless communications.
They may include the use of  software, passwords and codes.
The requirement of using technical means is a restrictive qualification to avoid over- criminalization.” Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No.
Therefore, the interception of data from electromagnetic emissions from a  computer system is included as an offence under this provision”, Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe  Convention on Cybercrime, No.
The Explanatory Report notes that: “A specificity of the offences included is the express requirement that  the conduct involved is done “without right”.
Thus, without restricting how Parties may  implement the concept in their domestic law, it may refer to conduct undertaken without authority (whether legislative,  executive, administrative, judicial, contractual or consensual) or conduct that is otherwise not covered by established  legal defences, excuses, justifications or relevant principles under domestic law.
The Convention, therefore, leaves  unaffected conduct undertaken pursuant to lawful government authority (for example, where the Party’s government  acts to maintain public order, protect national security or investigate criminal offences).
Furthermore, legitimate and  common activities inherent in the design of networks, or legitimate and common operating or commercial practices  should not be criminalized”.

1612 Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by General   Assembly Resolution 44/25 of 20 November 1989, entry into force 2 September 1990, in accordance with Article 49.
The Explanatory Report notes that: “A specificity of the offences included is the express requirement that  the conduct involved is done “without right”.
Thus, without restricting how Parties may  implement the concept in their domestic law, it may refer to conduct undertaken without authority (whether legislative,  executive, administrative, judicial, contractual or consensual) or conduct that is otherwise not covered by established  legal defences, excuses, justifications or relevant principles under domestic law.
The Convention, therefore, leaves  unaffected conduct undertaken pursuant to lawful government authority (for example, where the Party’s government  acts to maintain public order, protect national security or investigate criminal offences).
Furthermore, legitimate and  common activities inherent in the design of networks, or legitimate and common operating or commercial practices  should not be criminalised”.
1623 Regarding the challenges related to the use of encryption technology, see above: § 3.2.14.
One survey on child   pornography suggested that only 6 per cent of arrested child-pornography possessors used encryption technology.

1726 One example of this misuse is the publication of passwords used for access control.
Once published, a single password   can grant access to restricted information to hundreds of users.
In this respect the provision builds upon recent developments inside the Council of  Europe (European Convention on the legal protection of services based on, or consisting of, conditional access – ETS N°  178) and the European Union (Directive 98/84/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 November 1998  on the legal protection of services based on, or consisting of, conditional access) and relevant provisions in some  countries”.
72), the drafters of the Convention restrict devices to software.

§ 1029 ( Fraud and related activity in connection with access devices)   1733   See for example one approach in the US legislation:            (a) Whoever -  (1) knowingly and with intent to defraud produces, uses, or traffics in one or more counterfeit access devices;  (2) knowingly and with intent to defraud traffics in or uses one or more unauthorized access devices during any one- year period, and by such conduct obtains anything of value aggregating $1,000 or more during that period;  (3) knowingly and with intent to defraud possesses fifteen or more devices which are counterfeit or unauthorized  access devices;  (4) knowingly, and with intent to defraud, produces, traffics in, has control or custody of, or possesses device-making  equipment;  (5) knowingly and with intent to defraud effects transactions, with 1 or more access devices issued to another person  or persons, to receive payment or any other thing of value during any 1-year period the aggregate value of which is  equal to or greater than $1,000;  (6) without the authorization of the issuer of the access device, knowingly and with intent to defraud solicits a person  for the purpose of -  (A) offering an access device; or  (B) selling information regarding or an application to obtain an access device;  (7) knowingly and with intent to defraud uses, produces, traffics in, has control or custody of, or possesses a  telecommunications instrument that has been modified or altered to obtain unauthorized use of telecommunications  services;  (8) knowingly and with intent to defraud uses, produces, traffics in, has control or custody of, or possesses a scanning  receiver;                            310   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response                     (9) knowingly uses, produces, traffics in, has control or custody of, or possesses hardware or software, knowing it has  been configured to insert or modify telecommunication identifying information associated with or contained in a  telecommunications instrument so that such instrument may be used to obtain telecommunications service without  authorization; or  (10) without the authorization of the credit card system member or its agent, knowingly and with intent to defraud  causes or arranges for another person to present to the member or its agent, for payment, 1 or more evidences or  records of transactions made by an access device; shall, if the offense affects interstate or foreign commerce, be  punished as provided in subsection (c) of this section.

1739 Directive 2001/29/EC Of The European Parliament And Of The Council of 22 May 2001, on the harmonization of certain   aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.
73: The drafters debated at length whether  the devices should be restricted to those which are designed exclusively or specifically for committing offences, thereby  excluding dual-use devices.
It could lead to insurmountable difficulties of proof in  criminal proceedings, rendering the provision practically inapplicable or only applicable in rare instances.
The  alternative to include all devices even if they are legally produced and distributed, was also rejected.
As a reasonable compromise the  Convention restricts its scope to cases where the devices are objectively designed, or adapted, primarily for the purpose  of committing an offence.
This alone will usually exclude dual-use devices.
§ 2512 (2):       (2) It shall not be unlawful under this section for –   (a) a provider of wire or electronic communication service or an officer, agent, or employee of, or a person under  contract with, such a provider, in the normal course of the business of providing that wire or electronic communication  service, or  (b) an officer, agent, or employee of, or a person under contract with, the United States, a State, or a political  subdivision thereof, in the normal course of the activities of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision  thereof, to send through the mail, send or carry in interstate or foreign commerce, or manufacture, assemble, possess,  or sell any electronic, mechanical, or other device knowing or having reason to know that the design of such device  renders it primarily useful for the purpose of the surreptitious interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications.
For example, test-devices (‘cracking-devices’) and  network analysis devices designed by industry to control the reliability of their information technology products or to  test system security are produced for legitimate purposes, and would be considered to be ‘with right’.”          311   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response       1744 See Gercke, The Convention on Cybercrime, Multimedia und Recht 2004, page 731.

The Explanatory Report points out: “A specificity of the offences included is the express requirement that  the conduct involved is done “without right”.
Thus, without restricting how Parties may  implement the concept in their domestic law, it may refer to conduct undertaken without authority (whether legislative,  executive, administrative, judicial, contractual or consensual) or conduct that is otherwise not covered by established  legal defences, excuses, justifications or relevant principles under domestic law.
The Convention, therefore, leaves  unaffected conduct undertaken pursuant to lawful government authority (for example, where the Party’s government  acts to maintain public order, protect national security or investigate criminal offences).
Furthermore, legitimate and  common activities inherent in the design of networks, or legitimate and common operating or commercial practices  should not be criminalised”.

An especially  serious cases exists, as a rule, if the perpetrator:   1. acts professionally or as a member of a gang which has combined for the continued commission of fraud or  falsification of documents;   2. causes an asset loss of great magnitude;   3. substantially endangers the security of legal relations through a large number of counterfeit or falsified documents;  or   4. abuses his powers or his position as a public official.
It aims at filling gaps in criminal law related to traditional  forgery, which requires visual readability of statements, or declarations embodied in a document and which does not  apply to electronically stored data.
Computer-related forgery involves  unauthorised creating or altering stored data so that they acquire a different evidentiary value in the course of legal  transactions, which relies on the authenticity of information contained in the data, is subject to a deception.”   1764 See Art.

1790 The reason for the success is the fact that the provisions focus on the most relevant aspect of phase 1: transfer of the   information from the victim to the offender.
1791 Examples of acts that are not covered include the illegal access to a computer system in order to obtain identity related   information.
1792 One of the most common ways the information obtained is used is fraud.

1805 One example of this is Section 263 of the German Penal Code that requires the falsity of a person (mistake).
Fraud and related activity in connection with computers  (a) Whoever -  (1) having knowingly accessed a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access, and by means of  such conduct having obtained information that has been determined by the United States Government pursuant to an  Executive order or statute to require protection against unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national defense or  foreign relations, or any restricted data, as defined in paragraph y. of section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954,  with reason to believe that such information so obtained could be used to the injury of the United States, or to the  advantage of any foreign nation willfully communicates, delivers, transmits, or causes to be communicated, delivered,  or transmitted, or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted  the same to any person not entitled to receive it, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it to the officer or  employee of the United States entitled to receive it;  (2) intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtains -  (A) information contained in a financial record of a financial institution, or of a card issuer as defined in section  1602(n) of title 15, or contained in a file of a consumer reporting agency on a consumer, as such terms are defined in  the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 USC.
);  (B) information from any department or agency of the United States; or  (C) information from any protected computer if the conduct involved an interstate or foreign communication;  (3) intentionally, without authorization to access any nonpublic computer of a department or agency of the United  States, accesses such a computer of that department or agency that is exclusively for the use of the Government of the  United States or, in the case of a computer not exclusively for such use, is used by or for the Government of the United  States and such conduct affects that use by or for the Government of the United States;  (4) knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a protected computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized  access, and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value, unless the object of  the fraud and the thing obtained consists only of the use of the computer and the value of such use is not more than  $5,000 in any 1-year period;                  1807 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No.
The offence also requires a specific fraudulent or other dishonest  intent to gain an economic or other benefit for oneself or another.”   1817 The drafters of the Convention point out that these acts are not meant to be included in the offence established by   Article 8 – Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No.
The Explanatory Report notes that: “A specificity of the offences included is the express requirement that  the conduct involved is done “without right”.
Thus, without restricting how Parties may  implement the concept in their domestic law, it may refer to conduct undertaken without authority (whether legislative,  executive, administrative, judicial, contractual or consensual) or conduct that is otherwise not covered by established  legal defences, excuses, justifications or relevant principles under domestic law.
The Convention, therefore, leaves  unaffected conduct undertaken pursuant to lawful government authority (for example, where the Party’s government  acts to maintain public order, protect national security or investigate criminal offences).
Furthermore, legitimate and  common activities inherent in the design of networks, or legitimate and common operating or commercial practices  should not be criminalised”.

1823 For more information on the effects of digitization on the entertainment industry, see above: § 2.7.1.
1824 The technology that is used is called digital rights management – DRM.
The term digital rights management (DRM) is   used to describe several technologies used to enforce pre-defined policies controlling access to software, music, movies  or other digital data.
One of the key functions is copy protection, which aims to control or restrict the use and access to  digital media content on electronic devices with such technologies installed.

Remedies available shall include imprisonment and/or  monetary fines sufficient to provide a deterrent, consistently with the level of penalties applied for crimes of a  corresponding gravity.
In appropriate cases, remedies available shall also include the seizure, forfeiture and  destruction of the infringing goods and of any materials and implements the predominant use of which has been in the  commission of the offence.

They must all  understand what they can and can’t do on the Internet and be warned of the potential dangers.
As use of the Internet  grows, we’ll naturally have to step up our efforts in this respect.”   2029 Due to the protocols used in Internet communication and worldwide accessibility, there is very little need for a physical   presence at the place where a service is physically offered.
Due to this independence of place of action and the crime  site, many criminal offences related to the Internet are transnational crimes.
In these cases, the investigation nevertheless requires international cooperation between  the authorities in both countries, which in general is more time consuming compared to investigations concentrating on  a single country.

334   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response       2123   Regarding the possibilities of making reservations, see Article 42 of the Convention on Cybercrime:        Article 42  By a written notification addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, any State may, at the time of  signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, declare that it avails  itself of the reservation(s) provided for in Article 4, paragraph 2, Article 6, paragraph 3, Article 9, paragraph 4, Article  10, paragraph 3, Article 11, paragraph 3, Article 14, paragraph 3, Article 22, paragraph 2, Article 29, paragraph 4, and  Article 41, paragraph 1.
2125 “Although Parties are obligated to introduce certain procedural law provisions into their domestic law, the modalities of  establishing and implementing these powers and procedures into their legal system, and the application of the powers  and procedures in specific cases, are left to the domestic law and procedures of each Party.
These domestic laws and  procedures, as more specifically described below, shall include conditions or safeguards, which may be provided  constitutionally, legislatively, judicially or otherwise.
The modalities should include the addition of certain elements as  conditions or safeguards that balance the requirements of law enforcement with the protection of human rights and  liberties.
2126 “There are some common standards or minimum safeguards to which Parties to the Convention must adhere.
These   include standards or minimum safeguards arising pursuant to obligations that a Party has undertaken under applicable  international human rights instruments.” See: Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime,  No.

It is essential to have clear, detailed rules on the  subject, especially as the technology available for use is continually becoming more sophisticated” – Case of Kruslin v.  France, Application No.
2132 “The requirements of the Convention, notably in regard to foreseeability, cannot be exactly the same in the special   context of interception of communications for the purposes of police investigations as they are where the object of the  relevant law is to place restrictions on the conduct of individuals.
In particular, the requirement of foreseeability cannot  mean that an individual should be enabled to foresee when the authorities are likely to intercept his communications so  that he can adapt his conduct accordingly”, Case of Malone v. United Kingdom, Application No.
8-2), requires firstly that the  impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law”, Case of Kruslin v. France, Application No.

France, Application No.
2138 “Proportionality shall be implemented by each Party in accordance with relevant principles of its domestic law.
Other States will  apply related principles of their law, such as limitations on overbreadth of production orders and reasonableness  requirements for searches and seizures.” See: Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime,  No.
2140 “National legislatures will have to determine, in applying binding international obligations and established domestic   principles, which of the powers and procedures are sufficiently intrusive in nature to require implementation of  particular conditions and safeguards.” See: Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime,  No.
2143   “Also, the explicit limitation in Article 21 that the obligations regarding interception measures are with respect to a   range of serious offences, determined by domestic law, is an explicit example of the application of the proportionality  principle.” See: Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No.
“Due to the higher privacy interest associated with content data, the investigative measure is restricted to ‘a range of  serious offences to be determined by domestic law’.” See: Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on  Cybercrime, No.
The advantage of  separation of the obligation to preserve the data and the obligation to disclose them is the fact that it is possible to  require different conditions for their application.
2147 A definition of the term “subscriber information” is provided in Art.
2149 As described more in detail below, the differentiation between “computer data” and “subscriber information” in Art.
18   of the Convention on Cybercrime enables the signatory states to develop graded safeguards with regard to the  production order.
In order to trace these communications so as to determine their source or destination, traffic data  regarding these past communications is required”, see: Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on  Cybercrime, No.

The experts expressed their concerns regarding  implementation of a data retention obligation.
“Given the complexity of the above noted issues blanket solutions to  data retention will likely not be feasible.” Report of the Workshop on Potential Consequences for Data Retention of  Various Business Models Characterizing Internet Service Providers, G8 Government-Industry Workshop on Safety And  Security in Cyberspace Tokyo, May 2001.
2155 Regarding The Data Retention Directive in the European Union, see: Bignami, Privacy and Law Enforcement in the   European Union: The Data Retention Directive, Chicago Journal of International Law, 2007, Vol.
2157 See: Preface 11 of the European Union Data Retention Directive: “Given the importance of traffic and location data for   the investigation, detection, and prosecution of criminal offences, as demonstrated by research and the practical  experience of several Member States, there is a need to ensure at European level that data that are generated or  processed, in the course of the supply of communications services, by providers of publicly available electronic  communications services or of a public communications network are retained for a certain period, subject to the  conditions provided for in this Directive.”   2158 Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of The Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of   personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic  communications).
2159 See, for example: Draft Bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to protect youth from exploitation by adults using the  Internet, and for other purposes – Internet Stopping Adults Facilitating the Exploitation of Today’s Youth Act (SAFETY) of  2007, available at: www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-837.
Regarding the current situation in the US, see:  ABA International Guide to Combating Cybercrime, page 59.
2161 However, it is recommended that states consider the establishment of powers and procedures to actually order the   recipient of the order to preserve the data, as quick action by this person can result in the more expeditious  implementation of the preservation measures in particular cases.
337   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response       2164 “Preservation” requires that data which already exists in a stored form be protected from anything that would cause its   current quality or condition to change or deteriorate.
The drafters suggested that the  requirements for the handout of data to law-enforcement agencies could be adjusted in relation to the categories of  data.
174: “The conditions and safeguards referred to in  paragraph 2 of the article, depending on the domestic law of each Party, may exclude privileged data or information.
A  Party may wish to prescribe different terms, different competent authorities and different safeguards concerning the  submission of particular types of computer data or subscriber information held by particular categories of persons or  service providers.
For example, with respect to some types of data, such as publicly available subscriber information, a  Party might permit law enforcement agents to issue such an order where in other situations a court order could be  required.
On the other hand, in some situations a Party might require, or be mandated by human rights safeguards to  require that a production order be issued only by judicial authorities in order to be able to obtain certain types of data.
Parties may wish to limit the disclosure of this data for law enforcement purposes to situations where a production  order to disclose such information has been issued by judicial authorities.
The proportionality principle also provides  some flexibility in relation to the application of the measure, for instance in many States in order to exclude its  application in minor cases.”   2169 Gercke, Cybercrime Training for Judges, 2009, page 64, available at:   www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/economiccrime/cybercrime/Documents/Reports- Presentations/2079%20if09%20pres%20coe%20train%20manual%20judges6%20_4%20march%2009_.pdf.
If law-enforcement agencies know the IP address  an offender used to commit an offence, this information only enables them to identify the connection used to log on to  the Internet.
If a group of people had access to this connection (e.g.
in an Internet café), further investigations are  necessary to identify the offender.
2171 If the offender is using services that do not require a registration or if the subscriber information provided by the user is   not verified, Art.
18 Subparagraph 1b) is therefore especially relevant with regard to commercial services (like providing  Internet access, commercial e-mail or hosting services).

2175   Official Note: As noted in the expert group report, in some countries it may be necessary to apply the same standard  for production orders as is used for a search warrant because of the nature of the material that may be produced.
In  other countries it may be sufficient to employ a lower standard because the production process is less invasive than  the search process.
338   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response          Official Note: Countries may wish to consider whether subparagraph c is appropriate for inclusion in domestic law  because while it may be of great practical use, it requires the processing and compilation of data by court order,  which may not be suitable for some jurisdictions.
16: If a magistrate is satisfied on the basis of an ex parte application by a police officer that specified data stored  in a computer system is reasonably required for the purpose of a criminal investigation or criminal proceedings, the  magistrate may order that a person in control of the computer system disclose sufficient traffic data about a specified  communication to identify:  (a) the service providers; and  (b) the path through which the communication was transmitted.”       2177 For an introduction to data retention, see: Breyer, Telecommunications Data Retention and Human Rights: The   Compatibility of Blanket Traffic Data Retention with the ECHR, European Law Journal, 2005, page 365 et seq.
2178 Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the retention of data   generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of  public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC.

2193 Regarding the plans of German law-enforcement agencies to develop a software to remotely    access a suspect’s computer and perform search procedures, see: Blau, Debate rages over   German government spyware plan, 05.09.2007, Computerworld Security, available at:  www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9034459; Broache, Germany wants  to sic spyware on terror suspects, 31.08.2007, CNet News, available at: www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9769886- 7.html.
2195 Apart from the fact that direct access enables the law-enforcement agencies to examine the physical condition of   storage media, physical access to a computer system is the only way to ensure that the files on the suspect’s computer  are not modified during the investigation.
Regarding the importance of protecting the integrity of the examined  computer system, see: Meyers/Rogers, Computer Forensics: The Need for Standardization and Certification, page 6,  available at: www.utica.edu/academic/institutes/ecii/publications/articles/A0B7F51C-D8F9-A0D0- 7F387126198F12F6.pdf.
2197 “However, in a number of jurisdictions stored computer data per se will not be considered as a tangible object and  therefore cannot be secured on behalf of criminal investigations and proceedings in a parallel manner as tangible  objects, other than by securing the data medium upon which it is stored.
2200 See in this context: Winick, Search and Seizures of Computers and Computer Data, Harvard Journal of Law &   Technology, 1994, Vol.
2201 Regarding the requirements in the US, see for example: Brenner, Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law  Review, 2001-2002, Vol.
R (95) 13 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States concerning problems of      340   Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response        criminal procedural law connected with information technology that was adopted by the Committee of Ministers on  11.09.1995 at the 543rd meeting of the Ministers Deputies.
If the information is stored on a   computer system outside the territory, an extension of the search order could violate this principle.
The drafters of the  Convention on Cybercrime therefore pointed out: “Paragraph 2 allows the investigating authorities to extend their  search or similar access to another computer system or part of it if they have grounds to believe that the data required  is stored in that other computer system.
2208 Regarding the classification of the act of copying the data, see: Brenner/Frederiksen, Computer Searches and Seizure:   Some Unresolved Issues in Cybercrime & Security, IB-1, page 58 et seq.
2209 “Since the measures relate to stored intangible data, additional measures are required by competent authorities to   secure the data; that is, ‘maintain the integrity of the data’, or maintain the ‘chain of custody’ of the data, meaning that  the data which is copied or removed be retained in the State in which they were found at the time of the seizure and  remain unchanged during the time of criminal proceedings.
The term refers to taking control over or the taking away of  data”.
Compared to maintaining the integrity of copied data   it is often easier to maintain the integrity of data on a storage device.
2212 One possibility to prevent access to the information without deleting it is the use of encryption technology.
2213 See in this context: Williger/Wilson, Negotiating the Minefields of Electronic Discovery, Richmond Journal of Law and   Technology, Vol.
2214   The fact that law-enforcement agencies are able to access certain data stored outside the country through a  computer system in their territory does not automatically legalize the access.
This issue is discussed below at the Chapter on international co-operation.” Two cases of transborder  access to stored computer data are regulated in Art.
32 Convention on Cybercrime:  Article 32 – Trans-border access to stored computer data with consent or where publicly available   A Party may, without the authorisation of another Party:   a) access publicly available (open source) stored computer data, regardless of where the data is located  geographically; or   b) access or receive, through a computer system in its territory, stored computer data located in another Party, if the  Party obtains the lawful and voluntary consent of the person who has the lawful authority to disclose the data to the  Party through that computer system.
2215 “It addresses the practical problem that it may be difficult to access and identify the data sought as evidence, given the   quantity of data that can be processed and stored, the deployment of security measures, as well as the nature of  computer operations.

2219 Official Note: If the existing search and seizure provisions contain a description of the content of the warrant, either in a   section or by a form, it will be necessary to review those provisions to ensure that they also include any necessary  reference to computer data.
2220 Official Note: A country may wish to add a definition of “assist” which could include providing passwords, encryption  keys and other information necessary to access a computer.
2222 “A “production order” provides a flexible measure which law enforcement can apply in many cases, especially instead   of measures that are more intrusive or more onerous.
The implementation of such a procedural mechanism will also be  beneficial to third party custodians of data, such as ISPs, who are often prepared to assist law enforcement authorities  on a voluntary basis by providing data under their control, but who prefer an appropriate legal basis for such assistance,  relieving them of any contractual or non-contractual liability.” Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime,  No.
2224 “At the same time, a mere technical ability to access remotely stored data (e.g.
the ability of a user to access through a   network link remotely stored data not within his or her legitimate control) does not necessarily constitute “control”  within the meaning of this provision.
In some States, the concept denominated under law as “possession” covers  physical and constructive possession with sufficient breadth to meet this “possession or control” requirement.”  Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No.
2226 If the providers offer their service free of charge, they do often either require an identification of the user nor do at   least not verify the registration information.

174: “Party  may wish to prescribe different terms, different competent authorities and different safeguards concerning the  submission of particular types of computer data or subscriber information held by particular categories of persons or  service providers.
For example, with respect to some types of data, such as publicly available subscriber information, a  Party might permit law enforcement agents to issue such an order where in other situations a court order could be  required.
On the other hand, in some situations a Party might require, or be mandated by human rights safeguards to  require that a production order be issued only by judicial authorities in order to be able to obtain certain types of data.
Parties may wish to limit the disclosure of this data for law enforcement purposes to situations where a production  order to disclose such information has been issued by judicial authorities.
The proportionality principle also provides  some flexibility in relation to the application of the measure, for instance in many States in order to exclude its  application in minor cases.”    2231 For example, the requirement of a court order.
21 of the Convention on Cybercrime obliges the signatory states to implement the possibility to intercept content   data only with regard to serious offences (“Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be  necessary, in relation to a range of serious offences to be determined by domestic law”).
“Due to the higher privacy interest associated with content  data, the investigative measure is restricted to ‘a range of serious offences to be determined by domestic law’.” See:  Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No.

2238   Official Note: As noted in the expert group report, in some countries it may be necessary to apply the same standard  for production orders as is used for a search warrant because of the nature of the material that may be produced.
In  other countries it may be sufficient to employ a lower standard because the production process is less invasive than  the search process.
Official Note: Countries may wish to consider whether subparagraph c is appropriate for inclusion in domestic law  because while it may be of great practical use, it requires the processing and compilation of data by court order,  which may not be suitable for some jurisdictions.

“Such a situation could arise if, upon balancing the   important interests involved in the particular case (on the one hand, public interests, including the sound  administration of justice and, on the other hand, privacy interests), furnishing the specific data sought by the requesting  Party would raise difficulties so fundamental as to be considered by the requested Party to fall within the essential  interests ground of refusal.”    2366 See Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No.

literature  on  cybersecurity  and  cybercrime.
Although the following material does not include examination of all existing writing in the   area,  it  includes  a  number  of  important  sources  that  are  illustrative  of  the  main  issues   covered  in  contemporary  works  on  the  matters  of  cybersecurity  and  cybercrime.
The   following  material  is  presentation  of  the  main  themes  and  problems  as  reflected  by  the   literature  as  a  whole  without  providing  separate  reviews  on  specific  academic  or   professional  works.
Rather,  the  result  of  the  review  is  systematization  of  ideas  and   concerns as well as existing solutions on the problem of cybercrime and cybersecurity.
It is   an attempt to organize thinking and current state of academic knowledge on the issues of   cybersecurity in its very general form as allowed by the limitations of the projects.
Despite  the  initial  proposal  for  the  material  was  examination  of  the  literature  on   cybercrime, the  closer  analysis  revealed that  consideration of the issues of cybercrime  in   separation from a broader concern of cybersecurity would be incomplete and would fail to   reflect  the  entire  picture  of  the  problem  and  risks  associates  with  network  technologies.
The term cybercrime itself, first coined by William Gibson in 1982 and popularized in his   novel  Neuromancer,  became  a  popular  descriptor  of  the  “mentally  constructed  virtual   environment within which networked computer activity takes place.”1 This term has come   to symbolize the insecurity and risks online, and is generally referred to for description of   the  general  concerns  of  cybersecurity.
Although these concepts have yet to receive clear legal definitions and are to some extent   overlapping, in this work the term cybercrime refers to considerations of criminal law and   is a subset of the general cybersecurity concept.
Cybercrime therefore will be articulated as   a component of cybersecurity in light of the general concerns and problems generated by   the network and information technologies.

3   2  Executive Summary   With  the  development  of  information  and  network  technologies  and  the  growing   interconnectedness  of  the  world,  the  risks  connected  to  online  communication  have   become increasingly pressing.
Due to the global nature of such communication unhindered   by  physical  boundaries,  network  technologies  challenge  the  existing  international  legal   structure  based  on  such  notions  as  jurisdiction  and  sovereignty,  where  each  sovereign   jurisdiction  regulates  communication   that   takes  place   in   its   territory.
Online   communication,  that  bypasses  geographical  and  jurisdictional  restraints,  is  a  serious   concern for the national and international legal orders in their current form.
Communication  with  these  attributes  operating  in  the   boundless  environment  of  the  internet  open  doors  to  a  wealth  of  deviation,  misuse  and   crime.
Just like the network technology has penetrated virtually every sphere of life on the   planet, so did the risks associate with this technology.
The crime, facilitated by the network   and  computer  technologies,  has  become  cybercrime;  the  war,  in  turn  –  has  turned  cyber.
Risks  of  cyber  manifest  on  various  levels  –  national  and   transnational  (e.g.
cybercrime  and  cyberterrorism)  and  international  (e.g.
Collectively, these concerns are describes by the umbrella concept of cybersecurity.
On  the  national  and  transnational  levels,  the  matters  of  cybersecurity  primarily  concern   criminal matters.
Diversity  of   national  laws  is  one  of the  main  reasons  of  the  global  cybercrime  vulnerabilities,  as  such   diversity does not allow for the development of a single legislative response to the global   phenomenon.
Many  countries,  especially  developing  countries,  do  not  have  criminal  laws   that specifically address cybercrime.
4   On the international level, cybersecurity is concerned with the application of international   law to the realities of network and computer technologies, including the possibility of their   use  in  modern  warfare.
With  all  these  challenges  in  hand,  the  effective  legal  regulation  of  the  internet  presumes   creation of the viable policy that can adequately address the substance of the problem and   its technical complexity on various levels, including legislative interventions in the form of   criminalization  and  harmonization;  international  cooperation;  collaboration  with  the   private sector; professional educational and capacity building in terms of technical support   and assistance, especially in the developing countries.
3  General Introductory Remarks    As  information  technologies  become  increasingly  prevalent,  it  becomes  clear  that  the   global society finds itself in the midst of the communication and technology paradigm shift.
It is not the appearance of the new technology as such that defines the state of uniqueness   of  the  current  information  revolution,  as  the  human  society  has  seen  a  number  of  rapid   technological advances in the  past  without  quite  the  same  consequences.
Rather, it is  the   unprecedented  capability  of  network  and  information  technologies  to  enable  complex   global  communication  to  a  degree  of  unobstructed  “one-to-many  and  many-to-many   communication never before seen.”2     The globally-interconnected digital information and communication infrastructure created   by the network technologies touches practically everything and everyone.
With billions of   people  relying  on  the  internet  for  a  wide  variety  of  economic,  social,  and  political   interactions, cyberspace “is nothing short of essential to modern life.”3 It is estimated that   in just four years from now mobile broadband subscriptions will approach 70 per cent of   the  world’s  total  population.
By  the  year  2020,  the  number  of  networked  devices  will                                                               2 JULIE E. MEHAN, CYBERWAR, CYBERTERROR, CYBERCRIME: A GUIDE TO THE ROLE OF STANDARDS IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF  CHANGE AND DANGER 9  (IT Governance Publishing.

The  hyper-connectivity  of  the  modern  world  brings  a  wealth  of  benefits  for   governments,  enterprises  and  individuals  in  that  the  information  exchange  is  no  longer   dependent on physical constraints and is available immediately regardless of the distance.
Although  the  internet  is  omnipresent  in  modern  society  and  plays  a  critical  role  in  many   aspects  of  everyday  life,  it  was  never  intended  to  be  used  by  so  many  and  for  the  vast   number of functions it performs today.
To the contrary, the internet was designed to allow   a  small  group  of  scientists  to  share  unclassified  reports;  it  was  not  designed  to  transfer   sensitive information securely.5 Moreover, the internet was not designed to allow for easy   monitoring  of  user  behavior  and  was  not  designed  to  protect  against  attacks  originating   from  within  the  internet  itself.
That  same  inherent  design  persists  today,  largely   unchanged,  while  the  internet’s  uses  have  evolved  drastically.
The  ease  and  anonymity   with which people throughout the world can access information systems via the  internet,   coupled  with  the  internet’s  inherently  flawed  design,  have  created  a  vulnerability  to   cyberattacks on an unprecedented scale.
Targets of cyberattacks are diverse, and the costs   of  such  attacks  are  necessarily  borne  by  consumers,  private  industry,  and  governments   alike.
The  frequency  and  sophistication  of  cyberattacks  are  likely  to  increase,  as   instructions for sophisticated attack methods are made more widely available to would-be   attackers  via  the  internet,  reducing  the  technical  knowledge  required  to  carry  out  an   attack.6   The  level  of  connectivity  of  the  modern  world  and  inherent  vulnerabilities  of  the   communication  design  has  become  the  root  of  the  main  challenge  –  exploitation  of   vulnerabilities  in  technological,  organizational  and  legal  systems  of  regulation  by  all                                                               4 Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime xvii (John Sandage, et al.

However,  the  possibilities  exploiting  the  vulnerabilities  of  the  network   technologies in the  context of inter-connected world are  significant.
The  participants  include  criminal  enterprises,  ‘hackers’  (whether  for   financial  gain  or  as  a  challenge),  cause-based  groups,  proxies  for  governments,  and   governments  (including  their  military  and  intelligence  agencies).
Motives  for  the  attacks   range  from  financial  gain  to  the  advancement  of  national  security  interests,  to  the   satisfaction of peer recognition, and to the advancement of various causes.7   The  actual  subject  of  the  debate  therefore  is  not  a  new  type  of  crime  or  deviation,  but   fundamentally  reshaped  way  in  which  we  interact.
The  academic  discourse  on  the  social   impact of new technology is nothing new.
It is the longstanding concern expressed in the   volumes  on  industrial  sociology  from  Karl  Marx  to  many  contemporary  commentators.8   Much like the appearance of the automobile in 1920 created some degree of awe among the   socio-legal  thinkers,  the  internet  is  equally  apposite  of  the  new  technology  today.
9  This   new  technology  created  a  new  level  of  opportunities  where  social  deviance,  including   crime,  followed.
Computer  and  network  related  deviance  possesses  some  specificity  that   creates effects that national and international legal frameworks have never faced before.
Some  of  the  key  challenging  features  of  the  communication  mediated  by  network  and   information technologies are:    ?
Network  communication  does  not  require  any  degree  of  physical   proximity.
An instantaneous action is possible between   participants  who  are  in  different  cities,  states  or  countries.10  Current  legal   frameworks  are  traditionally  regarded  as  local  in  nature,  being  restricted  to  the                                                               7 David Satola & Henry L.

Modern  networked  technologies   have challenged this paradigm requiring significant adjustments to the law.11   ?
Anonymity is an obvious advantage of an   offender, and digital technology facilitates this in a number of ways.
Small participants of the internet communication have more capacity   to  exercise  hard  and  soft  power  in  cyberspace  than  in  many  more  traditional   domains.13  Launching  a  massive  cyberattack  does  not  require  a  large  number  of   people.
A  single  individual  with  the  access  to  the  internet  is  capable  of  such  an   attack  due  to  the  possibilities  of  the  network  and  information  technologies.
Given these challenges that these features introduce, the main question therefore is how to   ensure  effective  monitoring  and  regulation  of  user  behavior  in  the  integrated  global   information  network  in  the  presence  of  the  current  disintegrated  legal  framework   described by a large number of sovereign jurisdictions.
Due  to  the  fact  that  cyber  networks  present  a  unique  borderless  ‘space,’  it  becomes  a   lateral,  fluid  and  indivisible  single  system.15  As  such,  physical  analogies  of  space  (as  our   conceptual referent to describe the unfamiliar) are inapposite because cyberspace is not in   itself a place; it is an activity, a complex type of mediated communication.

These concerns should play an important role in the ongoing development of information   and  network  technology.
Enhancing  cybersecurity  and  protecting  critical  information   infrastructures  are  essential  to  each  nation’s  security  and  economic  well-being.
Legal   regulation  of  conduct  in  cyberspace  and  deterrence  of  misuse  of  ICTs  must  become  an   integral  component  of  a  national  cybersecurity  and  critical  information  infrastructure   protection strategy.
These   are the problems that for the sake of convenience can be described as that of jurisdictional                                                               16 Susan W.

The  sovereign  equality  of  states  is  protected  by  rules  of  customary  public   international  law.21  No  state,  therefore,  can  claim  sovereignty  over  cyberspace  and  thus   introduce its effective regulation.22    It is one thing to enact laws that regulate conduct, it is quite another to assert jurisdiction   over  conduct  that  may  be  located  or  originate  anywhere  in  the  world.
Given  the  relative  ease  with  which  online  offenders   can commit criminal acts remotely, the law enforcement response to criminal conduct must   rely  significantly  on  trans-border  mechanisms  such  as  mutual  legal  assistance  and   extradition.24 However, these mechanisms are not always readily available or practicable,   partially due to the different legal qualifications of online conduct in various jurisdictions.25   Specific conduct that is criminally punishable in the country A may not be criminal in the   country  B.
Yet,  the  alleged  offender  might  be  located  in  the  country  B  creating  effect  or   interfering  with  information  infrastructure  in  the  country  A.

Many developing countries have neither relevant   laws that regulate conduct in cyberspace and where necessary introduce responsibility for   breaches,  nor  do  these  countries  have  capacity  to  enforce  such  laws.
In  dealing  with  real   world  crime,  the  developed  world  can  ward  off  the  potential  threats  by  strengthening   physical  border control and introducing strict  immigration  policies that regulate  physical   migration.
Originating  in  the  Philippines,  the   malware infected millions of computers and caused an estimated $10 billion in lost work   hours  of  such  businesses  as  Ford,  Siemens,  and  Microsoft,  as  well  as  government   departments  of  various  countries.27  However,  prosecution  of  the  author  of  the  code,  a   graduate student whose thesis proposal on computer viruses had apparently been rejected,   proved difficult.
Because  of  this  legislative  deficiency,  the  suspect  could  not  be   extradited to countries that suffered harm and that had adequate laws for prosecution.28   4.2  Attribution: Determining the Responsibility for Harmful Conduct   The legal effects of the conduct in cyberspace can be seen from the perspectives of various   participants  of  online  communication  –  the  perspective  of  an  individual  (a  criminal  act,   regulated by the national criminal law) and the perspective of a state (an act of aggression   regulated by the international law).

11   internet does not allow distinguishing with ease between participants standing behind an   attack – an individual or a government.
The Tallinn Manual, a comprehensive text on the applicability of the existing   international  law  to  cyber  warfare,  recognizes  this  problem.29  As  countermeasures  can   only be lawful if it is for the offending state’s conduct, the attribution of conduct is crucially   important.
A  nation  must  show  that  a  cyberattack  qualifies  as  an  ‘armed  attack’  in  the   context  of  internationally  accepted  rules  of  warfare  in  order  to  respond  with  force,   otherwise nations are forced to rely only upon criminal proceedings.30    Thus,  there  are  two  dimensions  of  legal  effects  produces  by  harmful  online  conduct  –   provided  that  the  conduct  is  criminalized,  it  will  always  fall  within  the  ambit  of  criminal   law.
However,  if  the  effects  of  the  conduct  are  serious  enough  to  entail  consequences  for   the  national  security,  such  conduct  can  be  seen  in  the  dimension  of  cyberaggression  and   the international law.
Victimized nations seeking to take action under the current international legal framework   must  first  determine  the  source  and  nature  of  a  cyberattack.
Attributing a   physical attack perpetrated with traditional weaponry to those responsible involves a two-  prong  analysis;  it  is  determined  whether  another  nation  (as  opposed  to  individuals  or   other non-state groups) was responsible for the attack, and if not, the attack is addressed   as a criminal matter.
By  nature,   cyberwarfare  represents  a  disaggregation  of  combatants  and  requires  significant   geographic  dispersal  of  assets  where  the  identity  and  location  of  attackers  are  masked.
29 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare 29-37.
30 Stahl, GEORGIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AND COMPARATIVE LAW, 261-262 (2011).
Identifying responsible   parties  is  further  complicated  by  the  rapid  advancement  in  computer  technology,  which   creates  an  almost  continuous  learning  curve  that  places  law  enforcement  at  an  extreme   disadvantage  in  their  attempts  to  attribute  responsibility  for  an  attack.
The  technological   challenges  cyberspace  poses,  coupled  with  the  problem  of  asymmetry  and  anonymity,   exponentially increas the complexity of the cross-jurisdictional investigative challenges.31   It  is  common  for  online  attackers  to  use  so  called  ‘slave’  computers  owned  by  innocent   parties  in  their  assaults.
The  place  from  which  a  cyberattack  originated  is  ambiguous   because, while attacks might be routed though internet servers in, for example, China, they   might not originate in China.
The  problem,  at  its  core,  is   evidentiary;  a  nation  under  attack  must  properly  attribute  the  attack  before  choosing  a   course of action but rarely has immediate access to the necessary evidence, which is often   in a foreign jurisdiction and can be destroyed quickly and easily.
13   enforcement's  reliance  on  international  agreements  that  were  not  designed  with  the   unique problems of cyberaggression in mind.34   Some literature on the subject offers consideration of the severity of the attack and place of   origin  as  indicative  of  the  state  involvement  in  the  harmful  online  conduct.
Thus,  Tallinn   Manual  suggests  that  if  an  attack  is  launched  from  governmental  cyber  infrastructure,  it   might  be  indicative  of  governmental  involvement.
It is doubtful that any government is reckless enough to launch an cyber operation   against another country from its governmental portals when an easier solution would be to   use hacking personnel operating from anywhere else but the state infrastructure.
After all,   as the Manual recognizes, the government computers may have come under control of non-  state actors.35    5  Cybersecurity as an Umbrella Concept   In general, the literature suggests to distinguishing between various types of cybersecurity   concerns.
Cyberespionage  is  another  separate  cybersecurity   concern  connected  to  either  state  intelligence  or  such  notion  as  hacktivism.
Dividing   cybersecurity  into  manageable  components  facilitates  the  development  of  national  and   international law governing the rights and duties of individuals and nations with respect to   each category of activity (with the exception of espionage, there are no legal treaties that   regulate  espionage,  separating  cyberespionage  as  notion  that  falls  outside  the  legal   regulation).
This  approach  can  help  address  the  shortcomings  of  present  national  and   international legal frameworks in a more effective manner.36   As discussed, cyberattacks often do not closely resemble traditional criminal activity; it is   often difficult to establish that the conduct at issue is criminal, as opposed to an act of war   or terrorism.
In the context of cyberspace,  states generate crime and terrorism as well as   war,  and  individuals  wage  war  in  addition  to committing  crimes  and  carrying  out  acts  of                                                               34 Stahl, GEORGIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AND COMPARATIVE LAW, 260 (2011).

36 Stahl, GEORGIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AND COMPARATIVE LAW, 270 (2011).
Traditional   classifications  of  crime,  terrorism,  and  warfare  break  down  due  to  the  aforementioned   asymmetric nature of network communication.
By giving nonstate actors access to a new,   diffuse kind of power, cyberspace erodes states’ monopolization of the ability to wage war   and effectively levels the playing field between all actors.37   The legal and legislative analyses of cybersecurity issues must distinguish not only among   different  cyberthreat  categories  enumerated  above  and  actors,  such  as  nation-states,   terrorists, criminals, and malicious hackers, but also among different types of cyberthreats.
Such cyberthreats include threats to critical infrastructure, which could lead to loss of life   or  significant  damage  to  our  economy;  and  threats  to  intellectual  property,  which  could   affect a nation’s long-term competitiveness.38   Concerning critical infrastructure, some commentators believe that at the moment, there is   no  real  likelihood  that  non-state  actors  possess  the  capacity  to  bring  down  the  banks,   transportation  systems,  electric  grid,  and  communication  systems  through  catastrophic   cyberaggression.39 Wall, for example, attributes the ‘popularity’ of cybercrime to the media.
He  posits  that  the  media  construction  of  the  cybersecurity  imagery  is  so  spectacularly   dramatized and the internet is so newsworthy that a single dramatic incident of cybercrime   has  the  power  to  shape  public  opinion  and  fuel  public  anxiety,  frequently  resulting  in   demands  for  instant  and  simple  solutions  to  extremely  complex  situations.40  However,   despite  such  skepticism,  commentators  accept  that  cyberterrorism  and  cyberwar  are  a   nearing  reality.

Statistics  aside,  the  magnitude  of   harm posed by a major cyberattack was summarized in 2003 by Richard A. Clarke, former   Special  Advisor  on  Cyberspace  Security  to  President  George  W.  Bush,  in  his  testimony   before Congress:44   The  threat  is  really  very  easy  to  understand.

16   forms  of  more  serous  offending  –  identity  or  information  theft  from  the  computer  only   becomes serious when it is used against the owner (or incitement to violence).47   While  cybersecurity  concerns  of  non-critical  nature  do  not  generate  doubts  as  to  their   plausibility,  the  danger  to  which  the  critical  infrastructure  can  be  exposed  is  still   questionable.
In  order  to  demonstrate  the  true  scope  of  the  threat,  a  sober  analysis   provided  in  the  literature  of  the  largest  cybersecurity  incidents  in  recent  time  is   illustrative.48    The SQL Slammer    One of the earliest examples go back to 2003 when at 00:30 (EST) on January 25 a virus   that  is  known  as  Slammer  infected  its  first  computer:  a  web  server  running  Microsoft’s   database software SQL.
Slammer was designed to replicate itself and send new copies out   across the Internet.
That simple but efficient design ensured that in just three minutes, by   00:33, the number of infected machines was doubling every 8.5 seconds.49   One infected network belonged to Ohio utility company FirstEnergy; it was located in their   Davis-Besse  nuclear  power  plant.
Slammer  snaked  its  way  into  the  plant’s  systems  via  a   contractor’s unsecured connection and began to slow down the plant’s servers due to the   constant  flow  of  Slammer  copies  being  flung  out  across  the  network.
Eventually,  two   monitoring  systems  at  the  plant  crashed  and  were  not  restored  until  six  hours  had   passed.50  The  story  of  Slammer’s  infection  of  a  nuclear  power  plant  back  in  2003  is   indicative  of  the  vulnerabilities  of  the  digital  systems  of  control  of  critical  infrastructural   objects.
Moreover,  no  disruptions  in  service  or  power  outages  were  traced  to                                                               47 WALL, Cybercrime: The Transformation of Crime in the Information Age 209-210.

Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition  (SCADA) Systems Security and Stuxnet    Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are used to monitor and control   critical  industrial  processes  like  power  generation.52  A  variety  of  industries  across  the   globe employ some form of SCADA system.
SCADA systems were developed in the 1960s,   and  many  systems  based  in  whole  or  in  part  on  that  initial  design  remain  in  use  today.
These  technological  dinosaurs  were  never  designed  to  interface  with  massive  corporate   intranets that put SCADA systems within reach of the Internet and all its cyber pathogens,   such as Stuxnet.53   Stuxnet, discovered on July 14, 2010, was  described as  one of the most sophisticated and   unusual pieces of malicious software ever created and was the first worm built not only to   spy  on  industrial  systems,  but  also  to  reprogram  them,  and  manage  their  industrial   infrastructure.54  The  worm  spread  like  a  traditional  Windows-based  rootkit  but  was   uniquely  targeted  at  specific  SCADA  subsystems.
Though  tens  of  thousands  of  computers   were  ultimately  infected  with  Stuxnet,  the  ‘epicenter’  of  the  infection  was  Iran,  where  it   targeted five Iranian  industrial processing organisations.
Some security experts speculate   that  the  final  target  was  Iran’s  Bushehr  nuclear  power  plant,  a  fear  confirmed  at  least  in   part by the Iranian government.55 While Stuxnet did not take control of the nuclear facility,   which  it  was  more  than  capable  of  doing,  the  damage  it  caused  delayed  the  facility’s   opening by several months.
54 Stahl, GEORGIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AND COMPARATIVE LAW, 259 (2011).
18   India, Pakistan, and Indonesia raising concerns that once sophisticated malware is released   into a network, it can spread unpredictably.56   Though Stuxnet’s sophistication and specificity are indeed a cause for concern, once again,   the risks were blown out of proportion by the media and their cybersecurity sources.57 In   the aftermath of its detection, experts and media personnel alike were quick in putting the   implicative tag of ‘act of war’ onto the use of the malicious program, although no competent   justification  for  such  labeling  was  offered.58  Siemens,  the  manufacturer  of  the  targeted   machines,  reported  that  no  plant  operations  had  been  disrupted  as  a  result  of  Stuxnet.
Further,  the  Siemens  systems used in Iran were  modified and illegally acquired, meaning   they seemed to lack even the imperfect security measures typical of SCADA systems.59   Given the potential military capacity of Stuxnet, the problem of attribution is illustrative.
If   a hostile nation were able to seize control of a nuclear facility in this manner, a threatened   nation  would  find  it  difficult  to  justify  retaliation  by  force  under  existing  international   law.60   Information Security   Internet-based threats are not only about crippling infrastructure and disabling important   systems.
Information security is a prime consideration for many web-connected entities.
In   December  2010,  Google  was  on  the  receiving  end  of  a  cyberattack  intended  to  give  the   perpetrators  access  to  the  Gmail  accounts  of  various  Chinese  human  rights  activists.
Once  installed,  the  software  gave  the  attackers  the  ability  to   explore some of Google’s internal systems.61                                                               56 Stahl, GEORGIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AND COMPARATIVE LAW, 259 (2011).

Once  inside,  the  hackers  extracted  information  related  to  the   company’s  SecurID  authentication  products,  which  some  forty  million  businesses  use  to   add  another  layer  of  protection  to  their  networks.
Though  RSA  insists  the  stolen   information  does  not  enable  a  successful  direct  attack  on  any  of  their  RSA  SecurID   customers,  the  incident  does  illustrate  that  no  one  –  not  even  a  security  expert  –  is   perfectly safe.62   Attacks on Estonia and Georgia   The attack on Estonia represents the best-known example of a coordinated cyberattack on   a  sovereign nation’s critical infrastructure, and it  illustrates  the  need for an international   effort  to  coordinate  cybersecurity  policy.
The  damage  inflicted  by  the  attack  necessitated  a  response  from  the   Estonian  government;  however,  the  government  could  do  very  little  in  the  absence  of   established  procedures  for  international  cooperation  because  the  attacks  originated  in   foreign  jurisdictions.
The  attack  demonstrated  that  the  internet  is  a  viable  alternative  to   traditional  modes  of  warfare  and  terrorism.
It  also  reaffirmed  that  the  absence  of  a   comprehensive international legal framework with the flexibility to cope with the complex   nature  of  cyberspace  has  hampered  efforts  to  deter  such  acts  and  prosecute  those   responsible.63   Estonian public and private sectors suffered a prolonged cyberattack campaign that lasted   several  weeks.
The  attack,  which  occurred  in  waves  over  several  weeks,  disrupted  the   websites of the Estonian President and Parliament, the vast majority of Estonian ministries,   three  of  the  country’s  six  largest  news  organizations,  and  two  of  its  major  banks.
The   crippling  impact  of  the  attack  was  due,  in  part,  to  the  fact  that  the  Estonian  government   conducts  most  of  its  basic  operations  using  the  Internet.
63 Stahl, GEORGIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AND COMPARATIVE LAW, 250-251 (2011).
However,  the  speculation  that  Russian  government  was  behind  the   attacks  led  some  Estonian  officials  to  advocate  for  an  official  request  for  assistance   pursuant  to  Article  V  of  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty,  which  requires  members  of  the  North   Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO)  to  assist  an  ally  in  the  event  of  an  armed  attack.
Article V expressly states that such assistance may include use of ‘armed force’ against the   aggressor.
Moreover,  hackers  who  use  botnets  continue  to   develop  increasingly  sophisticated  command  structures  that  make  the  task  of  tracing  an   attack to the original source nearly impossible.
A subsequent U.S. government investigation   found that it is  not likely that Russian  security agencies were responsible for the  attacks,   but rather politically driven hackers.65   The attack on Georgia in 2008 was designed to disrupt the Georgian government’s ability to   communicate,  demonstrating  that  a  cyberattack  can  complement  traditional  armed   conflict.
A  DDoS  attack  can  be   enormously  effective  in  disrupting  an  enemy’s  ability  to  coordinate  defense  measures  in   preparing  for  an  armed  conflict,  transmit  emergency  communications  to  its  citizens,  and   communicate  with  the  outside  world.
Cyberattacks  are  a   cost  effective  alternative  or  complement  to  traditional  warfare,  as  the  cost  of  initiating  a   cyberattack relative to developing, producing, and using traditional weaponry is nominal.
Evidence   suggests  that  a  Russian  criminal  organization  was  responsible  for  the  attack,  but  the                                                              64 Id.

The  lack  of  consensus  on  who  initiated  the   attack underscores the challenge of determining who should ultimately be held responsible   for initiating a cyberattack.66   5.1  Cybercrime and Cybercrime Tools   Computer-related  crime  is  a  long-established  phenomenon,  but  the  growth  of  global   connectivity is  inseparably tied to the  development of contemporary cybercrime.
Today’s   cybercrime  activities  focus on utilizing globalized information communication technology   for committing criminal acts with transnational reach.67 Cybercrime is perhaps one of the   more clearly identified thematic areas of cybersecurity and the one where there is almost   universal  agreement  on  best  practice,  as  expressed  in  the  Budapest  Convention  (the   Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime).68   The  term  cybercrime  is  used  to  refer  both  to  traditional  crimes  (e.g.,  extortion,  fraud,   forgery, identity theft, and child exploitation) that are committed over electronic networks   and information systems as well as to crimes unique to electronic networks  (e.g., hacking   and denial of service attacks).69   ‘Definitions’  of  cybercrime  mostly  depend  upon  the  purpose  of  using  the  term.
Beyond this, however, computer-related acts for   personal or financial gain or harm, including forms of identity-related crime, and computer   content-related acts (all of which fall within a wider meaning of the term ‘cybercrime’) do   not  lend  themselves  easily  to  efforts  to  arrive  at  legal  definitions  of  the  aggregate  term.
Certain definitions are required for the core  of cybercrime acts.
22   investigative and international cooperation powers, which are better focused on electronic   evidence for any crime, rather than a broad, artificial ‘cybercrime’ construct.70    Numerous  academic  works  have  attempted  to  define   ‘cybercrime.’  National  and   international legislation, however, does not appear concerned with a strict definition of the   word.
Rather,  legislation  more  commonly  referred  to  ‘computer  crimes,’  ‘electronic   communications,’   ‘information  technologies,’   ‘high-tech  crime,’   ‘offence  relating  to   computer  information,’  ‘criminal  act  of  which  the  target  is  computer information,’  or  ‘the   use of information resources and (or) the impact on them in the informational sphere for   illegal purposes.’71   It  is  clear  from  these  approaches  that  a  number  of  general  features  could  be  used  to   describe cybercrime acts.
One approach is to focus on the material offence object – that is,   on the person, thing, or value against which the offence is directed.72 Another approach is   to consider whether computer systems or information systems form an integral part of the   modus  operandi  of  the  offence.73  Identifying  possible  cybercrime  offence  objects  and   modus  operandi  does  not  describe  cybercrime  acts  in  their  entirety,  but  it  can  provide  a   number of useful general categories into which acts may be broadly classified.74   In 2007, Wall suggested three main categories of cybercrime: (i) computer integrity crimes,   which are offences relating to the integrity of the computer systems (for example hacking   and  DDoS);  (ii)  computer  assisted  crimes,  which  are  offences  assisted  by  computers  (for   examples virtual robberies, scams and thefts); and (iii) computer content crimes, which are   offences  that  focus  on  the  content  of  computers  (for  example  pornography  and  offensive                                                               70 Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime xvii.

24   It should be noted that these basic tools are used to commit cyberattacks falling with the   categories – cybercrime and cyberaggression (cyber warfare).
Generally, cyberattacks are separated into three major categories: (i) ‘automated malicious   software delivered over the Internet,’ (ii) ‘denial-of-service attacks,’ and (iii) ‘unauthorized   remote  intrusions  into  computer  systems.’79  Recent  high  profile  attacks  perpetrated   against Estonia, Georgia, and Iran80 have involved a combination of these attack methods,   but  two  types  of  attack  are  of  particular  importance  because  they  are  relatively  easy  to   carry  out  and  they  are  extremely  effective.
Worms can spread within a host computer system and also to any system   connected to it by a network or the Internet.
Many cyberattacks involve another   form of malware that allows multiple computers to be remotely controlled by – or ‘slaved’   to the commands of – a single operator who can dictate the behavior of those computers.
This  method  of  attack,  used  in  the  2007  cyberattack  on   Estonia,  allows  a  cyberattacker  to  implement  a  coordinated  attack  from  numerous   locations,  including  within  the  target  network,  with  very  limited  warning  for  a  nominal   cost.81                                                               79 Mathhew J.

A DoS attack is initiated from a single computer and overwhelms a target computer   system  with  requests  until  the  system  can  no  longer  function  properly,  denying  users   access  to  and  use  of  the  targeted  system.
Both  methods  capitalize  on  basic  flaws  in  the  Internet’s   architecture and are often used in conjunction with one another to maximize damage to the   target system.
The recent cyberattacks on Estonia and Georgia offer vivid examples, as they   were carried out using a combination of malware and DoS known as a Distributed Denial of   Service (DDoS).82   In a DDoS attack, hackers use malware to take control of numerous computers and use the   hijacked computers – referred to as ‘zombies’ – to send a massive series of data packets to   the targeted networks.
A  network  of  compromised  ‘zombie’   computers is often referred to as a ‘botnet.’ In 2007, Vint Cerf, widely recognized as one of   the  fathers  of  the  Internet,  estimated  that  as  many  as  25%  of  networked  computers   worldwide, or 150 million computers, may be part of botnets.
Although hackers use other   methods  in  carrying  out  attacks,  malware,  DoS,  and  DDoS  used  in  recent,  high  profile   attacks demonstrates the urgency of addressing cyberattacks and the challenges they pose   for victimized nations.83   Describing  the  current  cyberthreat  landscape,  Kellerman  addressed  the  proliferation  of   targeted  attacks,  professionalization  of  cybercrime,  automation  and  commoditization  of   cyberattack  tools,  and  the  evolution  of  mobile  threats,  including  the  explosion  in  use  of   mobile malware.
Kellerman also identified several recent IT-related trends that challenge   our  ability  to  secure  cyberspace,  such  as  the  migration  to  cloud  computing,  the   consumerization of IT, the rise of social networking and social media, and the explosion in   the  use  of  mobile  devices.
26   urges  the  development  of  improved  standards  for  browser  security,  application  security,   and e-mail authentication in order to enhance cybersecurity and address cybercrime.84   5.2    Hacking and Hacktivism   Early on in the age of the personal computer, manycomputer users performed ‘hacks’: legal   or  illegal  computer  manipulations  (e.g.,  access,  defacement,  redirects)  of  computer   systems/networks  imbued  with  innovation,  style,  and  technical  virtuosity.85  Hacking   activity  today  involves  all  types  of  cyberattacks  utilizing  the  whole  range  of  cybercrime   tools.
When  hacking  becomes  explicitly   political  -  i.e.,  becomes  hacktivism  -  it  is  reframed  from  technical  feats  with  an  implied   philosophical underpinning to the explicit pursuit of attention for various issues in order to   shift public discourse, raise awareness, and create public pressure.86   Hacktivists share a set of beliefs, such as tolerance for legal risk, naming practices, scale of   collective  action  and  propensity  for  multinational  cooperation.
The controversial leaks made the organization                                                               84 Contreras, et al., AMERICAN UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW, 1117 (2013).
Fighting fire with fire, WikiLeaks supporters in the online group Anonymous   launched Operation Payback, orchestrating DDoS attacks of their own against MasterCard,   Visa,  and  PayPal89  (for  suspending  donations  to  WikiLeaks)  and  flirted  with  attacking   Amazon (for taking down the WikiLeaks site hosted on its servers).90   The  group  Anonymous  is  the  current  embodiment  of  the  idea  of  hacktivism.
There  are   other  examples  of  the  group  Anonymous  activity.
Thus,  in  April  2011,  Sony’s  PlayStation   Network - an online gaming community for the company’s top-selling video game console -   was  the  victim  of  a  more  intrusive  cyberattack.
Hackers  breached  security  safeguards  to   steal  data  from  each  of  the  PlayStation  Network’s  seventy-seven  million  individual  user   accounts, including birthdates and credit card numbers.
Upon discovering the breach, Sony   promptly shut down the PlayStation Network for more than a month in order to conduct a   thorough  security  and  damage  assessment.
Anonymous  caught  wind  of  the  event  and  after  investigating  the  dictatorship  in   greater  depth,  determined  the  Tunisian  government  was  guilty  of  widely  suppressing  its   citizens’  access  to  the  Internet,  or  at  least  portions  of  the  Internet  that  contained   unfavorable (but truthful) stories.
93   On 11 April 2013, Denmark experienced a massive DDoS attack on its country-wide digital   identification system NemID, for a few hours crippling the access to all services requiring   digital  identification,  which  covers  almost  all  areas  of  life  in  Denmark,  including  online   banking,  municipal  services,  taxation  and  health  care  systems,  real  estate  and  land   registration, library services, and many other areas.
Earlier same week, the websites of the   Danish  Local  Government  Association  (Kommunernes  Landsforening)  and  the  Danish   Social Democrats (Socialdemokraterne) had been subjected to DDoS attacks following the   group  Anonymous  declaration  of  support  of  the  Danish  Union  of  Teachers  (Danmarks   Lærerforening) in its dispute with the ‘Kommunerne.’94    Illustrated by the examples above, Anonymous is not defined as, and does not intend to be   defined  as,  the  traditional  cast  of  voiceless,  faceless  hackers.
29   unabashed moralistic/political motivations, and a proclivity to couple online cyberattacks   with offline protests.95   On  its  website,  Anonymous  describes  itself  as  an  internet  gathering  rather  than  a  group.
Moreover, Anonymous states that it has a very loose and decentralized command structure   that operates on ideas rather than directives.96 Prior to 2008, Anonymous had been most   notable  for  the  spread  of  harmless,  humorous  Internet  pranks  like  the  ‘rickroll’  and   ‘lolcats.’97 A clash with the Church of Scientology in January 2008 changed that perception,   however,  shedding  light  on  who  (or  what)  Anonymous  is  today.
The  group  began  a   campaign  against  the  Church  of  Scientology  after  the  Church  tried  to  suppress  Internet   media  outlets’  publication  of  a  notorious  video  of  movie  star  Tom  Cruise  speaking   fanatically  (and  incoherently)  about  the  religion.
Meanwhile,  online  members  raided  Scientology   websites  and prevented  the  Cruise  video  from altogether disappearing from the  Internet.
30   5.3  Cyberwar and Cyberterrorism    Wars  are  fought  within  the  context  of  their  age  with  the  weapons  determined  by  the   prevalent  technology  of  the  age.100  At  that,  concepts  like  electronic  warfare,  information   warfare, network warfare, cyberwar and cyberterrorism have been offered to explain the   emerging area  of conflict.
Unlike  kinetic weaponry, such as  weapons of mass destruction,   that  cause  numerous  casualties  instantaneously,  cyber  warfare  creates  disruptive  rather   than destructive effects with no less serious consequences.101    The  term  cyberwar  refers  to  actions  by  a  nation-state  to  penetrate  another  nation’s   computers or networks for the purposes causing damage or disruption.
It is believed that   the  world’s  largest  militaries  are  building  cyberwarfare  programs,  with  several  nation-  states  –  including  the  U.S.,  China,  Russia,  Israel,  and  Iran  –  already  considered  to  have   joined the ranks of the cyberwar-capable.
These potential military or terrorist threats are,   inter alia, the effects of cyberattacks (i) on the power grid could lead to cascading failures   across  the  nation  with  catastrophic  consequences;  (ii)  on  financial  systems  could  lead  to   economic  panic  and/or  a  crashing  stock  market;  (iii)  on  water  systems  could  open  dams   causing  flooding  or  make  entire  cities  uninhabitable;  (iv)  on  rail  systems  (e.g.,  involving   intentional  misrouting  of  trains)  could  cause  massive  collisions;  (v)  on  air-traffic  control   systems could lead to mass casualties; and (vi) on nuclear facilities could result in a nuclear   reactor meltdown, leading to catastrophic loss of life.102   As  already  discussed,  some  experts  have  suggested  that  cyberwar  concerns  have  been   greatly exaggerated.
A recent Dartmouth study of cyberwar funded by DHS concluded that   the  degree  of  damage  that  could  be  caused  in  a  cyberattack  bears  no  resemblance  to  an   electronic  ‘Pearl  Harbor,  although  inflicting  significant  economic  costs  on  the  public  and   private sectors and impairing performance of key infrastructures (via IT networks linked   to embedded computer systems, for example) seem both plausible and realistic.
Prominent   cybersecurity expert James Lewis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies has                                                               100 MEHAN, Cyberwar, Cyberterror, Cybercrime: A Guide to the Role of Standards in an Environment of Change  and Danger 21.

Cyber  weapons  will  have  difficulty  producing   casualties.
While  acknowledging  the  gravity  of  the  cyber  threat,  intelligence  officials   dramatically  toned  down  their  cyberwar  rhetoric  in  early  2013.
Rhetoric  aside,  experts  are  struggling  to  identify   appropriate responses to nation-state cyberattacks.104   The  U.S.  military  formally  distinguishes  between  two  types  of  offensive  cyberpower   available  to  nation-states:  Cyber  Network  Exploitation  (CNE)  and  Cyber  Network  Attack   (CNA).
Specifically,   CNAs are defined as actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny,   degrade,  or  destroy  information  resident  in  computers  and  computer  networks  or  the   computers and networks themselves.105   As with any traditional forms of war, there are different levels of intensity of cyberwar.
Some  will  engage  in  military  destructive  or  disruptive   activities, some – in intelligence gathering constituting cyberespionage.106   Although  creating  a  typology  of  cyber  operations  is  difficult  due  to  the  nature  of  the   technology involved,107 Mehan suggests the following calcification of the cyberwar: Class I   cyberwar  is  concerned  with  the  protection  of  personal  information  or  personal  privacy.
106 Greathouse, Cyber War and Strategic Thought: Do the Classic Theorists Still Matter?
107 See Kremer & Müller, Cyberspace and International Relations: Theory, Prospects and Challenges.
Class II cyberwar concerns itself with industrial and economic espionage, which can   be  directed  against  nations,  corporations  or  other  organizational  structures.
Class  III   cyberwar is about global war and terrorism, which includes cyberterrorism, but which may   also  include  attacks  against  other  parts  of  the  critical  infrastructure.
Finally,  Class  IV   cyberwar is the combination of the techniques of Classes I – III in combination with kinetic   military activities.108   As for the cyber weaponry itself, it includes all those basic cyber technics that we can find   in cybercrime, that is viruses, malware, denial of service, spying, jamming, blocking and so   on.109 The factors that distinguish cyberwar from cybercrime are the object and the level of   intensity of the attack and sophistication of the strategy of the attack.
An  interesting  and  rather  alarming  development  is  that  in  November  of  2011,  the  U.S.   Department of Defense concluded for the first time that cyberattacks can constitute an act   of  war  to  which  the  United  States  may  respond  using  traditional  military  force  (i.e.,  a   kinetic, rather than cyber-based, response).110   5.4  Cyberespionage – the Advanced Persistent Threat   Cyberespionage  refers  to  state-sponsored  theft  of  industrial  and  defense  secrets  and/or   intellectual property.111 The state sponsored cyberespionage poses a serious threat to the   economic  and  national  security.
Military  secrets  and  valuable  corporate  intellectual   property undermine the long-term competitiveness of the targeted countries.112   Some  prominent  examples  of  cyberespionage  include:  Moonlight  Maze  (1998);  Byzantine   Hades (2002); Operation Titan Rain (2003); Operation Buckshot Yankee (2008); Operation   Night Dragon (2008-2011); Operation Aurora (2009); penetration of Lockheed Martin, BAE   Systems and Northrop Grumman (2009); Operation Shady RAT (2006); GhostNet (2009);                                                               108 MEHAN, Cyberwar, Cyberterror, Cybercrime: A Guide to the Role of Standards in an Environment of Change  and Danger 28.

33   the RSA Breach (2011); and twenty-three natural gas pipeline operators (December 2011-  June 2012).113    By some reports, cyberespionage is estimated to cost the United States alone (in terms of   lost  jobs,  innovation,  and  national  security)  and  its  corporations  (in  terms  of  lost   intellectual property, remediation, and reduced consumer confidence) up toillion annually,   but  reliably  quantifying  the  potentially  staggering  costs  of  cyberespionage  has  been  an   elusive  goal.
Obstacles include  the  fact  that  many  companies  do  not know  that  they  have   been victimized and even those that do know are often reluctant to disclose out of concern   for their reputation.114   One  particularly  insidious  form  of  cyberespionage  is  known  as  an  advanced  persistent   threat (APT).
In many cases, they utilize   the full spectrum of computer intrusion technologies and techniques and combine multiple   attack  methodologies  and  tools  in  order  to  reach  and  compromise  their  target.
APT  operators  seek  long-term  access  to  their  targets,  with  attack   objectives generally extending beyond immediate financial gain.
In order to maintain long-  term  access  to  targets,  APTs  generally  operate  stealthily  for  as  long  as  possible.
Finally,   APTs  rely  on  skilled,  motivated,  organized  and  well-funded  operators  to  coordinate  and   execute attacks.
The substantial resources required to operate APTs generally makes them   a  tool  of  nation-states.
At  their  essence,  APTs  are  computer  intrusions  staged  by  threat   actors  that  aggressively  pursue  and  compromise  specific  targets,  often  leveraging  social   engineering or the ‘art of manipulation,’ in order to maintain a persistent presence within   the victim’s network so that they can move laterally and extract sensitive information.115   6  Legal Solutions and Strategies   While a viable cybersecurity policy includes a wide range of considerations, legal measures   play  a  key  role  in  the  prevention  and  combating  of  cybercrime.
These  are  required  in  all                                                               113 Teplinsky, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY BUSINESS LAW REVIEW, 253-255 (2013).
34   areas, including criminalization, procedural powers, jurisdiction, international cooperation,   and internet service provider responsibility and liability.
Countries increasingly recognize the need, however, for legislation in   other areas.116   The technological developments associated with cybersecurity and cybercrime mean that –   while traditional laws  can be  applied to  some  extent  –  legislation  must also grapple with   new concepts  and  objects, such as  intangible  ‘computer data,’ not traditionally addressed   by  law.
In  many  states,  laws  on  technical  developments  date  back  to  the  19th  century.
These laws were, and to a great extent, still are, focused on physical objects – around which   the daily life of industrial society revolved.
For this reason, many traditional general laws   do not take into account the particularities of information and information technology that   are associated with cybercrime and crimes generating electronic evidence.
These acts are   largely characterized by new intangible objects, such as data or information.117    While criminal law is often perceived as being most relevant when it comes to cybercrime,   the  legal  responses  to  wider  concerns  of  cybersecurity  also  include  the  use  of  other   branches  of  law,  such  as  civil  law  and  administrative  law.
Further  divisions  within  these   legal  regimes  include  substantive  and  procedural  law,  as  well  as  regulatory  and   constitutional,  or  rights-based,  laws.
However,  a   number of other areas of law are also important.118   The matter of criminalization of undesirable conduct in the internet has a two-fold effect:   (i) creation of the legal basis for retributive suppression of the conduct, and (ii) creation of   a  climate  of  social  unacceptability  of  cybercrime,  de-romanticizing  and  stigmatizing  such   conduct.
Those who use internet to commit crimes grew up with and were socialized by a   climate in which the predominating mode of unlawful activity was real-world crime, in its                                                               116 Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime xviii, 51.
Thus,  offences  involving  illegal   access to computer systems and data differ with respect to the object of the offence (data,   system, or information), and regarding the criminalization of ‘mere’ access as an inchoate   crime or the requirement for further intent, such as to cause loss or damage.
Most countries require the interference to be intentional, while   others  include  reckless  interference.123  For  interference  with  computer  data,  the  conduct   constituting  interference  ranges  from  damaging  or  deleting,  to  altering,  suppressing,   inputting  or  transmitting  data.
For those that do, differences arise regarding whether                                                               119 Susan W. Brenner, Toward a Criminal Law for Cyberspace: a New Model of Law Enforcement?, 30 RUTGERS  COMPUTER AND TECHNOLOGY LAW JOURNAL, 39 (2004).
36   the offence covers possession, dissemination, or use of software (such as malware) and/or   computer access codes (such as victim passwords).
From the perspective of international   cooperation,  such  differences  may  have  an  impact  upon  findings  of  dual-criminality   between countries.124   6.2  Hacktivism and Criminalization   Some  commentators  propose  that  targeting  hacktivism  (as  opposed  to  hacking)  in   criminalization  efforts  will  most  obviously  minimize  a  threshold  problem  in  the  larger   cybersecurity  debate.125  Perhaps  the  problem  is  that  criminalization  of  hacktivism  is  too   complex a legal issue involving specific intent to promote, inter alia, political goals.
Just  as   the  mafia  was  once  singled  out  as  the  face  of  organized  crime,  governmental  authorities   should capitalize on Anonymous’s visibility when discussing cybersecurity with the general   public.
According  to  a  2012   report published by Verizon, hacktivists (generally) overtook cybercriminals as the group   responsible  for  the  largest  amount  of  damage  resulting  from  cyberattacks  in  absolute   dollar  figures.
Moreover,  Anonymous  specifically  has  high  public  recognition  due  its   reliance  on  social  media  (Twitter  feeds,  YouTube  pages,  and  websites),  branding   mechanisms  (iconic  Guy  Fawkes  masks  and  naming  practices),  and  politically-charged   viewpoints  in  the  course  of  conducting  cyberattacks  on  highprofile  victims.
These  acts  constitute  such   crimes  as,  for  example,  illegal  access  to,  interception  and  interference  with  computer                                                              124 Id.
The  traditional   assumptions  about  a  perpetrator’s  being  observed  preparing  for,  committing  or  fleeing   from an offense no longer hold true.128 Challenges in the investigation of cybercrime arise   from  criminal  innovations  by  offenders,  difficulties  in  accessing  electronic  evidence,  and   from  internal  resource,  capacity  and  logistical  limitations.
Suspects  frequently  use   anonymization and obfuscation technologies, and new techniques quickly make their way   to a broad criminal audience through online crime markets.129   Identifying a perpetrator, investigating and gathering evidence of the crime can be difficult   for  various  reasons.
In  addition  to  the  anonymization  and  obfuscation  challenges,  the   country  that  hosts  the  cybercriminal  and  his  activities  may  not  define  what  is  done  as   illegal and may therefore be unable to prosecute him or cooperate in his being extradited   for  prosecution  elsewhere;  the  host  nation  may  not  have  agreements  in  effect  with  the   victim nation which obligate it to assist in gathering evidence that can be used against the   perpetrator;  or  extremely  volatile  electronic  evidence  may  have  been  destroyed,   advertently  or  because  it  was  routine  transactional  data  that  was  not  retained  by  the   Internet Service Provider which the offender used to commit the crime.

It  can  exist  in  the  form  of  computer  files,   transmissions,  logs,  metadata,  or  network  data.
Digital  forensics  is  concerned  with   recovering – often volatile and easily contaminated – information that may have evidential   value.
Forensics techniques include the creation of ‘bit-for-bit’ copies of stored and deleted   information  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  original  information  is  not  changed,  and   cryptographic  file   ‘hashes,’  or  digital  signatures,  that  can  demonstrate  changes  in   information.
This  means  that  sufficient  numbers  of  forensic  examiners,  availability  of   forensics  tools,  and  backlogs  are  required  on  the  part  of  the  law  enforcement  due  to   overwhelming quantities of data for analysis.
Suspects make use of encryption, rendering   access to this type of evidence difficult and time-consuming without the decryption key.
In   most  countries,  the  task  of  analyzing  electronic  evidence  lies  with  law  enforcement   authorities.133    An additional challenge is usage of the technology on the part of the law enforcement – at   the moment, cyber offenders seem to better utilize the technological capabilities that they   have.
Many developing   countries  globally  do  not  have  sufficient  resources  for  prosecutors  to  do  so.
The same holds true for the                                                               131 WALL, Cybercrime: The Transformation of Crime in the Information Age 160.

Judicial  training  on  cybercrime  law,   evidence collection, and basic and advanced  computer knowledge  represents a particular   priority.135   Many  jurisdictions  do  not  make  a  legal  distinction  between  electronic  evidence  and   physical  evidence.136  While  approaches  vary,  many  countries  consider  this  good  practice,   as it ensures fair admissibility alongside all other types of evidence.
A number of countries   outside  of  Europe  do  not  admit  electronic  evidence  at  all,  making  the  prosecution  of   cybercrime,  and  any  other  crime  evidenced  by  electronic  information,  unfeasible.
While   countries  do  not,  in  general,  have  separate  evidentiary  rules  for  electronic  evidence,  a   number of countries referred to principles such as: the best evidence rule, the relevance of   evidence,  the  hearsay  rule,  authenticity,  and  integrity,  all  of  which  may  have  particular   application to electronic evidence.137   6.4  Harmonization of Laws   Many countries have elements of the legal enabling environment addressing cybersecurity   and cybercrime, but these national legal frameworks vary widely in terms of the manner in   which  these  issues  are  addressed.138  In  today’s  globalized  world,  the  law  consists  of  a   multitude of national, regional and international legal systems.
This can be undertaken in a number of   ways, including through both binding and non-binding international or regional initiatives.
40   of states, or expressed within a  multilateral instrument  –  such as  a treaty or non-binding   international standard.139   One  of  the  main  arguments  in  favor  of  unification  of  laws  across  jurisdictions  is  to  avoid   safe  havens  and  penalty  havens  for  perpetrators.
Thus,  if  harmful  acts  involving  the   internet are criminalized, for example, in State A, but not in State B, a perpetrator in State B   can be free to target victims in State A via the internet.
Even  where  its   criminal law allows the assertion of jurisdiction over the perpetrator in State B, it will still   require consent or assistance from State B – either regarding the gathering of evidence, or   the  extradition  of  the  identified  perpetrator.
The  harmonization  of   procedural  law  is  a  second  indispensable  requirement  for  effective  international   cooperation.
In other words, a requested state can   only  provide  assistance  within  its  territory,  to  the  extent  that  it  could  do  so  for  an   equivalent national investigation.141   6.5   Incident Reporting and Information Sharing   Because of the difficulties arising when trying to define and identify cybercrime, nationally   and  cross-nationally  comparative  statistics  on  cybercrime  are  much  rarer  than  for  other   crime  types.142  The  measures  that  might  be  wanting  are  those  that  would  improve   transparency   through  obliging   individual  and  corporate  victims,  under  certain   circumstances, disclose data breaches.143                                                               139 Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime 56-58.
It  is  important  to  highlight  initiatives  for  increasing  reporting,  including   online  and hotline reporting systems,  public awareness  campaigns, private sector liaison,   and  enhanced  police  outreach  and  information  sharing.
The inability to construct the offender   profile leads to inability to isolate offender motivation for the purposes of criminalization,   for  example.146  Reliable  information  about  cybercrime  informs  policy,  practice,  and  the   public.
It helps to prevent information sources from over-representing their own interest   and  it  reconciles  the  needs  of  the  state  and  interests  of  other  stake-holders,  rather  than   dividing them.
Reliable information helps shape public expectations more realistically.147   6.6   Institutional Arrangements for Cybersecurity Bureaucracy   The institutional arrangements  supporting cybersecurity are as  varied and diverse  as  the   approaches  to  the  issues.
Second,  not   all cybersecurity issues have a specific institutional dimension.

42   area  of  cybercrime,  where  practice  indicates  that  issues  of  cybercrime,  once  passed  into   legislation, are usually within the purview of the law enforcement and the judiciary.148   In terms of privacy, for example, a number of examples demonstrate the wide practice of   institutional responses:   In  the  E.U.,  generally,  each  country  has  a  Data  Protection  Agency  (DPA)  principally   responsible for the interpretation and enforcement of data privacy violations.
level,  there  is  a  Working  Party  on  Data  Protection  that   determines which countries are compliant with the Directives.149   In  Argentina,  the  National  Data  Protection  Directorate  (NDPD)  established  under  the   Personal Data Protection Act is responsible for digital data protection.
The NDPD is under   the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights.150   In  Canada,  at  the  federal  level,  the  Personal  Information  Protection  and  Electronic   Documents  Act  (PIPEDA)  assigns  its  oversight  and  enforcement  role  to  the  Office  of  the   Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) which reports to Parliament.151   In  Malaysia,  processing  of  personal  data  is  regulated  by  the  Personal Data  Protection  Act   2009 (PDPA).
The Personal Data Protection Commissioner is appointed by the Ministry of   Information, Culture, and Communications and is in charge of implementing and enforcing   the personal data protection laws in Malaysia.152                                                                148 Satola & Judy, WILLIAM MITCHELL LAW REVIEW, 1781 (2011).
43   In  South  Africa,  the  Protection  of  Personal  Information  Act  (PPIA)  requires  that  personal   information may only be processed by a responsible party that has notified the information   Protection Regulator (Regulator), which reports to the President of South Africa.153   Strong  governmental  involvement  and  institutional  solutions  in  securing  cyberspace  are   justified due to the heavy dependence of the government on technology and cyberspace for   its  own  operations.
In  addition,  government  has  a  unique  vantage  point  from  which  to   observe and understand global economic, political, and technological forces that could give   rise to cyberthreats.154   On the international level, if members of the international community were able to develop   a convention mandating international cooperation on cybersecurity and applying universal   jurisdiction  to  acts  of  cyberaggression,  the  benefits  would  be  palpable.
One  such  benefit   would  an  opportunity  to  create  a  UN  agency  comparable  to  the  International  Maritime   Organization  (IMO)  whose  purpose  would  be  to  ensure  the  safety  and  security  of  the   internet.155    The  IMO  was  created  pursuant  to  the  adoption  of  the  Convention  on  the  International   Maritime  Organization.
The  purpose  of  the  IMO  is  to  facilitate  cooperation  among   governments  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  highest  practicable  standards  in  matters   concerning  maritime  safety  are  in  place.
The  IMO  also  maintains  detailed  records  of  all   incidents  of  piracy,  which  supports  the  IMO’s  policy  recommendations  and  efforts  to   develop  new  law  when  the  need  arises.
The  IMO’s  strategy  consists  of  compilation  and   distribution of periodical statistical reports, piracy seminars and field assessment missions   to regions affected by piracy and the preparation of a code of practice for the investigation   and prosecution of the crime of piracy.
An agency similar in function to the IMO dedicated   to  tracking  incidents  of  cyberaggression  and  fostering  cooperation  between  member   nations  would  help  to  consolidate  the  international  effort  to  monitor  and  deter                                                               153 Id.
155 Stahl, GEORGIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AND COMPARATIVE LAW, 270-271 (2011).
Moreover, such an agency would help to legitimize the international legal   regime that created it, and would provide sound policy rooted in empirical evidence.156   6.7  Personnel Recruitment and Educational Training   There  is  a  need  for  many  governments  to  broaden  cybersecurity  personnel  recruitment   and  educational  training  efforts  (in  particular  for  law  enforcement,  judiciary  and  other   authorities).
The  US  government,  for  example,  established  the  National  Institute  for   Cybersecurity  Education  (NICE).
NICE  together  with  the  Department  of  Education,  and   other  agencies  launched  a  four-prong  strategy  to  build  a  cyber  savvy  nation  through   training,  awareness,  through  post-graduate  educational  programs,  and  professional   development  for  federal  security  professionals.
To  meet  that  goal,  NICE  targeted  a  wide   array of the population as prospective employees: students and private sector partners.157   Any  cybersecurity  reform  legislation  should  make  these  arrangements  permanent.
First,  in  a  world  of  ever-increasing  connectivity,  more   cybersecurity  will  be  needed  to  manage  that  connectivity,  so  there  will  be  a  parallel   increase  in  demand  for  cybersecurity  jobs.
Second,  through  enhancing  its  presence  in   recruitment  and  education,  the  federal  government  can  attract  those  individuals  to  fill   cybersecurity  jobs  who  might  otherwise  have  joined  the  ranks  of  Anonymous  or  other   hacker  groups.
Additionally,  increased  recruitment  efforts  might  even  help  persuade  those  who   already have joined hacktivist endeavors to work for governments.159    7  Technical Solutions   There are two basic technical strategies for critical systems protection – (i) defending the   system  from  the  internet  risks  while  the  system  stays  online,  and  (ii)  air  gapping  the   system and the general networks, that is a disconnection of such critical systems from the   internet  entirely  by  the  authorities.160  Such  proposals  have  recently  been  popular  with   some politicians in light of the developments with the US National Security Agency leaks.
7.1  Defense and Monitoring Systems    The  US  government  partially  guards  its  computers  and  networks  with  an  intrusion   detection system nicknamed ‘Einstein.’ The Einstein software is designed to conduct real-  time surveillance on, make threat-based decisions on, and provide an intrusion prevention   system  for  any  activity  taking  place  in  certain  government  computer  networks.
In   performing  these  functions,  Einstein  shares  information  and  cooperates  with  the   Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Agency.
Thus, currently within   its  own  network,  the  US  government  closely  coordinates  among  departments,  wipes   personally identifiable information from shared cybersecurity data, and operates on a real-  time response basis.161   As  for  defense  systems  for  the  private  sector,  or  maintaining  cyber-hygiene,  many   cybersecurity  experts  believe  that  basic  cyberhygiene  is  a  simple  and  logical  first  step  in   corporate  cybersecurity.
Rather  than  waiting  for  legislative  mandates  to   spur  corporate  cybersecurity  spending,  corporations  would  be  wise  to  consider  whether   some  proactive  investments  in  basic  cyber-hygiene  are  warranted  as  part  of  their  basic                                                               159 Id.
However,  even  basic  cyberhygiene,  let  alone  sophisticated   software such as Einstein, is expensive, if not costprohibitive, for some companies.162   If not subsidizing private sector in equipping private sector with cost-prohibitive defense   systems, an important source component for developing technical solutions for the private   sector  can  be  seen  in  identification  of  vulnerabilities,  security  breaches  and  potential   hazards.
This can be achieved by communication crucial findings on vulnerabilities to the   network owners and the private sector.163   7.2  Standardization and Air-Gapped Networks   Standardization  can  be  seen  as  both  an  advantage  and  a  disadvantage.
Standards  are   necessary  for  the  interoperability  of  products  by  multiple  vendors.
Interoperability  is   critical  in  communications  and  national  infrastructure,  including  the  national  power  grid   and  the  medical  and  financial  establishments.
The  result  of  the  tens  of  thousands  of   standards in use toda, is a world that is massively interconnected.
The interoperability in   critical  infrastructural  assets  helps  prevent  and  hinder  cybersecurity  risks  through,  for   example,  development  of  improved  standards  for  browser  security,  application  security,   and e-mail authentication.164    With  increased  interconnection  and  unified  standards,  however,  comes  increased   vulnerability,  both  to  external  and  internal  threats.165  The  use  of  identical  security   processes  on  every computer network  does  not seem to be  an  optimal solution –  at least   not  without  weighing  the  competing  costs.166  The  negative  effect  of  interoperability  is   greater potential vulnerability of the entire system, which is easier access to the rest of the   systems  once  a  part  of  it  is  compromised.
This  includes  spread  of  viruses  and  other   malware,  as  well  as  hacking.
47   Some  commentators  suggest  disconnecting  critical  system  networks  from  the  internet   entirely;167  such  systems  as  power  generation  and  water  distribution,  core  services  the   nation  depends  on  to  remain  functioning.
The  security  industry  refers  to  this  process  as   creating an “air gap” between supercritical systems and the general network.
Air gaps may   be somewhat burdensome, but the security payoff is unparalleled: air-gapped systems are   fully  isolated  and  practically  impervious  unless  an  attacker  manages  to  physically  access   the system.
168   8  Policy Considerations   A  viable  cybersecurity  framework  shall  aim  at  the  development  of  the  adequate   cybersecurity  culture.
Therefore  it  shall  include  national  and  international  cooperative   efforts  to  develop  standards,  methodologies,  procedures,  and  processes  that  align  policy   comprising  legislation,  business,  education  and  technology  approaches  to  address  cyber   risks.169 Given the inclusive and comprehensive nature of the desirable policy framework,   the  private  sector  will  naturally  play  as  significant  a  role  in  the  implementation  of  the   policy as does the public sector.
At that, the policy on cybersecurity and cybercrime shall be   informed  by  the  adequate  understanding  of  the  cyber-vulnerability  threat  on  the  part  of   the policy developer.170    In this light, perhaps the most critical of all problems connected with the development of a   viable cybersecurity policy framework is the problem formulated by Shane as “the current   state  of  public  ignorance  and  indifference  to  this  issue,”171  which  includes  executive  and   legislative  authorities  of  various  jurisdictions.
Although there are many legislative initiatives addressing   cybersecurity in many jurisdictions, it is unlikely that executive and legislative authorities   of the majority of governments have sufficient understanding of cybersecurity as an actual                                                               167 RICHARD A. CLARKE & ROBERT KNAKE, CYBER WAR: THE NEXT THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY AND WHAT TO DO  ABOUT IT 132  (Harper Collins.
48   problem of policy.172 That is not to say, of course, that the governments see the matters of   cybersecurity  as  unimportant.
Rather,  there  are  no  viable  and  comprehensive  policies  at   place  that  would  aim  at  cultivation  of  social  awareness  of  the  cyber  risks  and  adequate   skills to manage these risks.
The  issues  of  policy  suggest  considerations  that  would  incentivize  the  parties  with  the   greatest  capacity  to  improve  the  security.
The  public  good  with  regard  to  public  security   shall  be  balanced  against  other  public  goods,  such  as  privacy,  productivity,  economic   growth,  organizational  flexibility,  military  effectiveness,  government  transparency,  and   accountability.173  To  this  end,  Shane  suggests  that  “only  such  initiative  –  which  looks  at   cybersecurity  through  the  eyes  of  everyone  whose  interests  are  implicated  –  will  be   adequate to produce the sort of political movement that can produce significant change.”174   At that, policy considerations shall not be based on an “security at all costs” approach and   avoid alarmist or sensationalist rhetoric that has no touch with reality, which could lead to   weakling of such public goods as government transparency and accountability.175    Also,  the  policy  considerations  should  include  longstanding  and  controversial  issues.
What  is  the  government’s  proper  role  vis-à-vis  the  private  sector   cybersecurity given that the internet is largely private-sector-owned and operated?
Would   legislative  action,  such  as  setting  voluntary  or  obligatory  cybersecurity  standards  for   critical infrastructure incentivize the right behavior or inhibit innovation?176   To this end, some believe that the most important cybersecurity issue is ensuring that the   private  sector  adequately  adheres  to  standards  for  critical  infrastructure  protection  and   propose  that  the  law  enforcement  agencies  take  the  lead  in  creating  a  regulatory  model.
Others believe that the most important cybersecurity problem to be solved in the near term                                                               172 Id.
49   is ensuring a better flow of information between the private and public sectors and that the   intelligence community has the necessary expertise to lead the way.177   8.1  Vulnerability Mitigation and Threat Deterrence   Contreras  et  al  suggest  that  the  cybersecurity  policy  shall  be  based  not  only  on  reactive   vulnerability  mitigation,  that  is,  on  developing  protection  against  cyber-threats,  but  also,   and for the most part, on threat deterrence.
Vulnerability mitigation alone cannot provide   for the adequate level of sustainable security as even the most sophisticated defenses can   be defeated by those with the adequate resources and the will.178 In this light, the role of   the private sector in development of deterrence policies is warranted exactly because the   private sector owns a significant portion of critical infrastructure worldwide.
Some countries, such as the United States, which has the largest cyber infrastructure on the   planet,  has  adopted  a  largely  self-regulatory,  market-based  approach  to  cybersecurity,   relying on the private sector to secure its own networks.
In keeping with this approach, no   federal agency is responsible for defending the civilian domain, and the federal government   has avoided generally-applicable federal mandates regarding private sector cybersecurity   practices.179   There are two main strategies to address harmful conduct: (i) to react after such conduct   has  been  committed  in  order  to  incapacitate  and  punish  the  actor(s);  (ii)  to  prevent  the   conduct  from  occurring;  the  two  strategies  are  not  necessarily  inconsistent.
One   reason why prevention is a small part of the current strategy is that it is resource-intensive;   this implies not only qualitative and quantitative increase in policing of the environment in   which  undesirable  conduct  may  occur,  but  also  collaboration  with  other  cybersecurity   participants,  such  as  community  members.
When these assumptions are valid, the   model  works;  police  officers  who  know  the  area  stand  a  good  chance  of  being  able  to   identify  and  apprehend  perpetrators,  and  the  local  legal  system  stands  a  good  chance  of   being  able  to  convict  and  punish  them.
The  assumptions  predicated  on  territory  are  irrelevant  in  dealing  with   cybercrime.183   In  addition  to  the  traditional  retributive  justice,  cybercrime  deterrence  includes  the   promulgation  of  legislation,  effective  leadership,  development  of  criminal  justice  and  law   enforcement  capacity,  education  and  awareness,  the  development  of  a  strong  knowledge   base,  and  cooperation  across  government,  communities,  the  private  sector  and   internationally.
At  that,  the  cybercrime  strategies  are  likely  be  closely  integrated  in                                                               180 Brenner, RUTGERS COMPUTER AND TECHNOLOGY LAW JOURNAL, 42 (2004).
51   cybersecurity  strategies,  highlighting  components  on  awareness  raising,  international   cooperation, and law enforcement capacity.184   The continued importance of public awareness raising campaigns, including those covering   emerging  threats,  and  those  targeted  at  specific  audiences,  such  as  children,  was   highlighted by responding Governments, private sector entities, and academic institutions.
User  education  is  most  effective  when  combined  with  systems  that  help  users  to  achieve   their  goals  in  a  secure  manner.
If  user  cost  is  higher  than  direct  user  benefit,  individuals   have  little  incentive  to  follow  security  measures.
Private  sector  entities  also  report  that   user  and  employee  awareness  must  be  integrated  into  a  holistic  approach  to  security.
Foundational principles and good practice referred to include accountability for acting on   awareness,  risk  management  policies  and  practices,  board-level  leadership,  and  staff   training.
Two-thirds  of  private  sector  respondents  had  conducted  a  cybercrime  risk   assessment,  and  most  reported  use  of  cybersecurity  technology  such  as  firewalls,  digital   evidence preservation, content identification, intrusion detection, and system supervision   and monitoring.
Nearly half of   countries have passed data protection laws, which specify requirements for the protection   and use of personal data.
Some of these regimes include specific requirements for internet   service  providers  and  other  electronic  communications  providers.
While  data  protection   laws  require  personal  data  to  be  deleted  when  no  longer  required,  some  countries  have   made  exceptions  for  the  purposes  of  criminal  investigations,  requiring  internet  service   providers to store specific types of data for a period of time.
Many developed countries also   have  rules  requiring  organizations  to  notify  individuals  and  regulators  of  data  breaches.
Internet  service  providers  typically  have  limited  liability  as  mere  conduits  of  data.
While  technical  possibilities  exist  for  filtering  of  internet  content  by   service  providers,  restrictions  on  internet  access  are  subject  to  foreseeability  and   proportionality  requirements  under  international  human  rights  law  protecting  rights  to   seek, receive and impart information.186   Public-private partnerships are central to cybercrime prevention.
These  are  created  in  equal  numbers  by  informal   agreement  and  by  legal  basis.
Private  sector  entities  are  most  often  involved  in   partnerships,   followed  by  academic   institutions,  and   international  and  regional   organizations.
Partnerships are mostly used for facilitating the exchange of information on   threats and trends, but also for prevention activities, and action in specific cases.
Academic  institutions  play  a  variety  of  roles  in  preventing  cybercrime,  including  through   delivery of education and training to professionals, law and policy development, and work   on  technical  standards  and  solution  development.
Crucial to the success   of  crime  control  policies  is  the  ability  of  the  implementer  not  only  to  control  the  design   process  of  the  technology  and  its  support  systems,  but  also  to  be  able  to  identify  and   vulnerabilities and then to be able to modify design accordingly prior to production.188    8.2  Private-Public Sector Dynamic     As mentioned above, the role of the private sector in policy consideration can be structured   two-fold – (i) cooperation between the private and public sectors and (ii) introduction by                                                               186 Id.

53   the public sector of cybersecurity standards and their enforcement through imposition of   administrative  and/or  criminal  sanctions, as well as  creating cybersecurity infrastructure   in  the  form  of  specialized  regulatory  agencies.
The  basic  problem  of  cooperation  between  the  public  and  private  sectors  is  the  lack  of   incentives  sufficient  to  make  companies  in  most  critical  infrastructure  sectors  take   voluntary  action  to  bring  the  security  of  their  networks  to  the  level  needed  for  national   security.189  The  main  theme  tension  between  the  public  and  private  sectors  is  seeking   forms  of  justice  that  represent  their  different  interests.190  The  relatively  low  levels  of   prosecutions for breaches of computer security and low levels of recorded internet-related   fraud  are  poignant  examples  of  this  tension.
They  suggest  that  most  breaches  of  security   tend to be dealt  with by victims rather than the police, highlighting the  preference of  the   private  sector  to  seek  private  justice  solutions  instead  of  invoking  the  public  criminal   justice  process  that  might  expose  their  weaknesses  to  customers  or  commercial   competitors.
This indicates that the model of criminal justice offered to corporate victims   by  the  police  and  other  public  law  enforcement  agencies  is  not  generally  regarded  as   conductive to their business interest.191   A key challenge to achieving an adequate private sector investment in cybersecurity is the   fact that cybersecurity is a public good.
One company’s underinvestment in cybersecurity   can  redound  to  the  detriment  of  other  companies  with  whom  they  connect.
While  some   companies may be  motivated to  invest sufficiently to protect their own  assets,  others are   unlikely  to  invest  sufficiently  to  protect  the  assets  of  companies  with  whom  they  do   business,  leading  some  experts  to  conclude  that  the  private  sector  is  unlikely  to  supply   adequate cybersecurity on its own.192                                                               189 Teplinsky, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY BUSINESS LAW REVIEW, 305 (2013).

In the United States, the so called Task Force Proposal193 reveals a hesitation to   endorse  any  legislative  package  that  contains  a  significant  level  of  federal  government   involvement in cybersecurity.
This approach contrasts sharply with the so called Obama Proposal, the   Cybersecurity  Legislative  Proposal,  which  envisions  considerable   investment   in   cybersecurity  infrastructure  coupled  with  directly  mandated  cybersecurity  standards  for   the  private  market.
Second,  the  Task  Force  Proposal  would  create  a  non-governmental   agency to establish cybersecurity standards for private entities, where the Obama Proposal   would  delegate  that  authority  to  the  federal  law  enforcement  agencies,  such  as  the   Department  of  Homeland  Security.
Moreover,  while  the  Task  Force  Proposal  standards   would be voluntary, the standards promulgated by the law enforcement agencies under the   Obama Proposal would be mandatory for covered entities.194    This  dynamic  underlies  a  fundamental  problem  of  the  situation  with  legal  regulation  of   cybersecurity and cybercrime in that law, policy, and market mechanisms are experiencing   significant  difficulty  keeping  pace  with  the  rapid  and  enormous  technological  changes.
Although industry has made significant changes to address cybercrime, there is a dire need                                                               193 At least twenty-two different cybersecurity-related legislative proposals, in the form of Congressional  bills, executive proposals, and formal recommendations from a Republican House of Representatives task  force.

International  best  practice,  if  not  international  cooperation  and  collaboration,  is  more   evident  in  the  area  of  cybercrime,  perhaps  due  in  part  to  the  near  universality  of  the   substantive provisions of the Budapest Convention.198   It  often  is  said  that  cybercrime  knows  no  borders,  meaning  that  criminals  can  with  ease   and effectiveness commit crimes across national boundaries through the use of the internet   and  associated  electronic  communications.
This  observation  is  then  contrasted  with  the   traditional  limitations  faced  by  law  enforcement  agencies  and  judicial  systems,  which   remain stubbornly circumscribed by geographical limitations on investigative, prosecution,   and judicial powers, as in the observation, cybercrime knows no borders, yet the criminal   law remains fundamentally territorial in nature.199   Despite  the  fact  that  many  attacks  are  carried  out  across  multiple  jurisdictions  and  often   originate in foreign countries, current international law does not recognize nations as duty   bound  to  assist  in  investigating  a  cyberattack  that  allegedly  originated  within  their   jurisdiction.
As a result, nations attempting to develop and enforce cybersecurity measures   often lack international support from nations where a given cyberattack likely originated.

Since evidence of a cyberattack may be disposed of quickly,   current  international  agreements  like  MLATs  providing  for  law  enforcement  cooperation   operate too slowly to be effective.200   No nation-state can achieve adequate cybersecurity on its own; international coordination   and  cooperation  must  be  part  of  the  response.201  The  current  international  cooperation   takes  no  account  of  the  specificities  of  electronic  evidence  and  the  global  nature  of   cybercrime.
A lack of   common  approach,  including  within  current  multilateral  cybercrime  instruments,  means   that requests for actions, such as expedited preservation of data outside of those countries   with  international  obligations  to  ensure  such  a  facility  and  to  make  it  available  upon   request,  may  not  be  easily  fulfilled.
Globally,  divergences  in  the  scope  of  cooperation   provisions  in  multilateral  and  bilateral  instruments,  a  lack  of  response  time  obligation,  a   lack  of  agreement  on  permissible  direct  access  to  extraterritorial  data,  multiple  informal   law  enforcement  networks,  and  variance  in  cooperation  safeguards,  represent  significant   challenges to effective international cooperation regarding electronic evidence in criminal   matters.202   Moreover, sovereignty and other issues present countries with inherently conflicting policy   objectives and cultural clashes, including the need to balance different interests and rights   such  as  security  and  privacy,  and  are  compounded  by  the  impact  of  rapidly  developing   technologies on the structure of any agreement.203    Despite the challenges, in recent years there have been notable law enforcement successes.
Some of these have involved a high degree of international law enforcement cooperation,   assisted  by  modernized  understandings  of  legal  jurisdiction  and  the  use  of  cross-border    mechanisms such as  mutual legal assistance  and extradition.204 Because  law enforcement                                                               200 Stahl, GEORGIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AND COMPARATIVE LAW, 249-250 (2011).
204 Urbas, JOURNAL OF INTERNET LAW, 1-8 (2012).
Cooperation can occur with minimal formality, through temporary   officer-to-officer contacts, or through more established channels of communication such as   24/7  contact  points  for  law  enforcement,  as  envisaged  in  the  Council  of  Europe’s   Convention on Cybercrime.205   Forms  of  international  cooperation  include  extradition,  mutual  legal  assistance,  mutual   recognition of foreign judgments, and informal police-to-police cooperation.206 Due to the   volatile nature of electronic evidence, international cooperation in criminal matters in the   area  of  cybercrime  requires  timely  responses  and  the  ability  to  request  specialized   investigative  actions,  such  as  preservation  of  computer  data.
Response  times  for  formal   mechanisms, that are used currently, are of the order of months, for both extradition and   mutual legal assistance requests, a timescale which presents challenges to the collection of   volatile electronic evidence.207 Initiatives and innovations for informal cooperation and for   facilitation  of  formal  cooperation,  such  as  24/7  networks,  offer  important  potential  for   faster response times.208   Formal  and  informal  modes  of  cooperation  are  designed  to  manage  the  process  of  State   consent  for  the  conduct  of  foreign  law  enforcement  investigations  that  affect  a  state’s   sovereignty.
Increasingly,  however,  investigators,  knowingly  or  unknowingly,  access   extraterritorial data during evidence gathering, without the consent of the state where the   data  is  physically  situated.
This  situation  arises,  in  particular,  due  to  cloud  computing   technologies  which  involve  data  storage  at  multiple  data  centres  in  different  geographic   locations.
Direct foreign law enforcement access to extraterritorial data                                                               205 Id.
58   could  occur  when  investigators  make  use  of  an  existing  live  connection  from  a  suspect’s   device,  or  where  investigators  use  lawfully  obtained  data  access  credentials.
Law   enforcement  investigators  may,  on  occasion,  obtain  data  from  extra-territorial  service   providers  through  an  informal  direct  request,  although  service  providers  usually  require   due legal process.209   Examples of such cooperation between law enforcement officers in different countries are   provided  by  several  recent  cases  in  which  Australian  suspects  have  been  prosecuted  in   relation  to  child  grooming.
At  an  arranged  meeting  with  “Jamie”  the  suspect  was  arrested  and  then   charged.210   Such examples depend on relationships of trust that have been developed through regular   contact  between  law  enforcement  agencies  or  officers  in  different  countries.
With  states  in  Eastern  Europe  or  in  developing  countries,  new  relationships   have been forged.

Clearly,  this  is  important  in  ensuring  that  all  members  of   globally dispersed groups can be apprehended before they have an opportunity to flee or to   destroy  evidence.
Significant  internationally  coordinated  enforcement  actions  have  been   reported  against  international  child  exploitation  rings  and  global  copyright  piracy   groups.212    An example is the recent Operation Delego, which resulted in the dismantling of an online   pedophile network using a private, highly encrypted bulletin board known as Dreamboard.
This  network  included  more  than  500  members,  and  its  strict  rules  of  access  and   membership, which required the posting of child exploitation material including images of   children  who  were  abused  specifically  to  produce  new  material  for  the  network,  were   printed  in  English,  Russian,  Japanese,  and  Spanish.
The  international  enforcement   operation  resulted  in  the  charging  of  72  members  with  conspiring  to  advertise  and   distribute  child  pornography  and  50  also  were  charged  with  engaging  in  a  child   pornography enterprise, located across five continents and 13 countries: Canada, Denmark,   Ecuador, France, Germany, Hungary, Kenya, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Qatar, Serbia,   Sweden,  and  Switzerland.
This  involved  the  collaborative  efforts  of  the  DOJ  and   Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement  (ICE),  the  European  Union’s  Judicial  Cooperation   Unit, and the law enforcement agencies of the other countries involved.213   The  private,  governmental,  and  non-governmental  sectors,  on  the  basis  of  both  national   and international efforts, have been taking steps to increase the security of their products,   services,  and  networks.
These  efforts  include,  for  example,  the  work  of  international   standards  bodies,  which  range  from  the  treaty-based  International  Telecommunication                                                               211 Id.
60   Union  (ITU)  to  non-governmental  but  highly  influential  and  essential  bodies  such  as  the   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
Important issues for consideration include the role   of standards and the role of government in developing standards.214   Despite  the  positive  examples  of  cooperation,  in  terms  of  an  evolving  cybersecurity  legal   framework,  there  are  a  number  of  evident  vulnerabilities  and  impediments  to  effective   international cooperation.
Among these are:215   Dissonance in national approaches to cybersecurity.
Different countries, even members of   the  same  regional  organizations,  can  take  different  approaches  to  the  concept  of   cybersecurity in terms of national policies, laws, and implementation.
Some countries see   Internet governance as having state security at its core, by which they mean that the State   can  know  exactly  who  sent  and  received  every  transmission,  every  transmission's   traceroute,  and  the  contents  of  every  transmission;  it  can  delete,  block,  and/or  seize  any   transmission  of  which  it  disapproves;  and  it  can  punish  efficiently  those  who  send  or   receive  unapproved  transmissions.
At  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum  are  countries  and   organizations  that  strongly  believe  that  proper  Internet  governance,  including  Internet   security,  must  be  integrated  and  balanced  with  the  type  of  freedoms  protected  by   instruments  such  as  the  First,  Fourth,  Fifth,  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  of  the  United   States  Constitution,  the  European  Union  Charter  of  Fundamental  Rights,  and  numerous   United Nations  human  rights  documents.
This “dissonance” can lead to a  lack of effective   coordination and can result in part because of a lack of multi-stakeholder participation in   both policy-making and legislation.216   Cybersecurity  is  a  twenty-first  century  problem  that  requires  twenty-first  century   responses.
However, in the legal sphere, many concepts developed in an analog era simply   do not apply in a digital era or they cause friction when applied.
For example, the lack of   consensus  on  the  fundamental  and  related  issues  of  jurisdiction  and  sovereignty  make  it   difficult  to  effectively  cross  borders  to  address  international  cybersecurity  incidents.
In order for the rule of law to prevail, the inherent cross-border nature   of  cyberspace  seems  to  require  such  agreements  for  the  mutual  expansion  of   jurisdiction.217    Existing  tools  and  instruments  are  not  fully  applied  or  are  only  partially  implemented.
Another  source  of  vulnerabilities  in  the  existing  cybersecurity  legal  frameworks  results   from  failure  to  apply  the  terms  of  existing  instruments  or  only  partial  implementation  of   such instruments.
Legal systems are increasingly responding to this source of vulnerability   by  establishing  liability  for  failure  to  implement  existing  cybersecurity  tools  in  a  manner   proportional  to  the  sensitivity  of  the  data  held.
This  liability  may  be  imposed  because   proportional  security  mechanisms  were  not  employed  as  promised  or  regardless  of   whether  a  promise  was  made.
However,  this  liability  is  often  imposed  on  a  case-by-case   basis  and  not  pursuant  to  statutory  or  regulatory  requirements  aimed  at  the  particular   issue.218   10 Treaty-Based Approach to Cybersecurity and Cybercrime   The  international  community  has  a  clear  interest  in  developing  a  comprehensive,   multilateral cybersecurity framework because the widespread use of the internet in every   aspect  of  daily  life  has  created  an  almost  irreversible  dependence  on  its  technological   benefits,  and  because  the  conceptual  underpinnings  of  existing  legal  frameworks  are  not   readily adaptable to threats emerging in cyberspace.219   No  comprehensive   international   legal  framework  addressing  cybersecurity  exists.
International efforts to address the issue have been narrow in scope, focusing primarily on   data privacy regulations and human rights, at the expense of a broader effort to define and   differentiate various levels of cyberaggression and codify an international approach to deal                                                               217 Id.

62   with  its  challenges.220  In  the  absence  of  codified  law,  nations  attempting  to  enforce  their   cybersecurity  regimes  against  foreign  perpetrators  have  done  so  largely  by  analogy  to   international  law  governing  military  use  of  force221  and  domestic  criminal  law.
Existing   international cybersecurity agreements are narrow in scope, focusing on criminal activity   in cyberspace, and fail to adequately account for cyberspace as a platform for terrorism and   military action.222    These shortcomings may be due, in part, to the nature of cyberaggression, which challenges   the  conceptual  categories  we  have  so  far  used  to  avoid  chaos  and  maintain  order  in  our   societies and in our lives.
Without a comprehensive international definition of the types of   cyberaggression,  nations  will  continue  to  face  challenges  in  assessing  the  legality  of  their   response  to  a  given  attack.
Also,  because  there  is  no  international  body  authorized  to   investigate  and  prosecute  cyberaggression  without  limitation  based  upon  the  attack’s   location, nations resort to legal systems founded on the principle of territorial jurisdiction   in  crafting  a  response  to  cyberattacks.
Nations’  efforts  are  hampered  by  the  fact  that   international   law  recognizes  no  duty   to  assist  other  nations   in   investigating   cyberaggression absent an explicit agreement to the contrary among the parties.223   A comprehensive international treaty is wanting on some or all aspects of the cybersecurity   problem.224  When  analyzing  the  merits  of  a  treaty-based  approach  to  cybersecurity,  a   myriad  of  questions  arise,  including:  What  are  the  key  issues  that  should  or  could  be   addressed in a cybersecurity treaty?
How  could  countries  globally  be   supported  in  the  strengthening  of  their  cybersecurity  capacities,  through  technical   assistance and other means?225                                                               220 Id.

63   Any effort to reach international consensus on cybersecurity is likely to expose a range of   concerns,  which  in  part  flow  from  different  visions  of  national  security,  of  the  role  and   value of the  internet, of human  rights, and of economic policy.
Some see cybersecurity as   having state security at its core, which leads to an emphasis on capabilities to monitor and   attribute transmissions and to block any undesirable content.
Others strongly believe that   internet governance (including internet security) involves the integrating and balancing of   interests, including not only national security, but also human rights and the economic and   developmental interests associated with a vibrant, innovative, and competitive ICT sector.
These differing perspectives manifest themselves in many areas, including, for example, the   increasing debate over the issue of attribution, referred to above.226   Although  no  significant  developments  in  the  promulgation  of  a  cybersecurity  treaty  have   been  seen  in  the  last  decade,  the  promulgation  of  international  and  regional  instruments   aimed  at  countering  cybercrime  have  been  more  successful.
These  include  binding  and   nonbinding  instruments.
Five  clusters  of  international  or  regional  instruments  can  be   identified,  consisting  of  instruments  developed  in  the  context  of,  or  inspired  by:  (i)  the   Council of Europe or the European Union, (ii) the Commonwealth of Independent States or   the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, (iii) intergovernmental African organizations, (iv)   the League of Arab States, and (v) the United Nations.227   These  clusters  are  not  absolute  and  a  significant  amount  of  crossfertilisation  exists   between  the  instruments.
The  basic  concepts  developed  in  the  Council  of  Europe   Cybercrime  Convention,  for  example,  are  also  found  in  many  other  instruments.
United   Nations  entities,  such  as  UNECA  and  ITU,  have  also  had  some  involvement  in  the   development  of  instruments  in  the  African  context,  including  the  Draft  African  Union   Convention.228   A number of the  instruments  –  notably the  Council of Europe  Conventions, the  European   Union  instruments,  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  Agreement,  the  Shanghai   Cooperation  Organization  Agreement,  and  the  League  of  Arab  States  Convention  –  are                                                               226 Id.
Rather, they are designed to serve as inspiration or ‘models’ for development of   national   legislative  provisions.
Non-binding   instruments  may  nonetheless  have  a   significant influence at the global or regional level when many states choose to align their   national laws with model approaches.229   The  Council  of  Europe  Cybercrime  Convention  has  the  largest  number  of  signatures  or   ratifications/accessions (48 countries), including five Non-member States of the Council of   Europe (Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Panama, Philippines, and   Senegal).
Other  instruments  have  smaller  geographic  scope  –  the  League  of  Arab  States   Convention  (18  countries  or  territories),  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States   Agreement  (10  countries),  and  the  Shanghai  Cooperation  Organization  Agreement  (6   countries).
The  enumerated  international  instruments  exhibit  differences  in  substantive  focus.
Others,  such  as  the  Shanghai  Cooperation  Organization  Agreement  and  the   Draft African Union Convention, take a broader approach, of which cybercrime is just one   component.
The  Shanghai  Cooperation  Organization  Agreement,  for  example,  addresses   cooperation in cybercrime matters within the context of international information security   – including information warfare, terrorism and threats to global and national information   infrastructures.
The Draft African Union Convention takes a cybersecurity-based approach   that  includes  organization  of  electronic  transactions,  protection  of  personal  data,                                                              229 Id.
65   promotion  of  cybersecurity,  e-governance  and  combating  cybercrime.
Such  differences   significantly  affect  the  way  in  which  cybercrime  is  ‘framed’  within  the  international  or   regional legal response.
Due to its broader focus on international information security, for   example, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Agreement does not set out specific cyber   acts that should be criminalized.
Similarly – perhaps due to its focus on cybersecurity as a   whole,  rather  than  criminal  justice  in  particular  –  the  Draft  African  Union  Convention   presently  does  not  seek  to  establish  mechanisms  of  international  cooperation  in   cybercrime criminal matters.231   11 General Recommendations   There  are two major areas that are in need of governmental attention at the moment: (i)   development  of  comprehensive  and  clear  policies  on  cybersecurity,  and  (ii)  development   and  adoption  of  relevant   legislation  supporting  the  policy  that  would  enhance   cybersecurity.
The  considerations  of  the  policy  is  of  utmost  importance  and  should  include  first  and   foremost long-term educational efforts on all levels of society including general education   on  cybersecurity  matters,  as  well  as  professional  education  of  law  enforcement,  judiciary   and  legislative  authorities.
Also,  an  important  component  of  a  viable  policy  is  promoting   international  discussion  on  the  issues  cybersecurity  and  its  management  on  an   international level.
While  international  cooperation  is  necessary,  each  nation  will  have  to  develop,  as  a   foundation,  its  own  national  cybersecurity  strategy,  authorities,  and  capabilities.
Within   any  given  nation  state,  adequate  cybersecurity  will  require  effective  coordination  and   cooperation among governmental entities on the national and sub-national levels as well as   the private sector and civil society.
From the crime prevention and criminal justice perspective, six key areas may benefit from   either  binding  or  non-binding  guidance  at   international  or  regional   level:  (i)   criminalization;  (ii)  law  enforcement  procedural  powers;  (iii)  procedures  regarding                                                               231 Id.
66   electronic evidence; (iv) state jurisdiction in cybercrime criminal matters; (v) international   cooperation  in  cybercrime  criminal  matters;  and  (vi)  the  responsibility  of  service   providers.
Issues  for  consideration  in  the  area  of  private  sector  involvement  include:  What  are  the   most  effective  means  to  promote  effective  coordination  and  cooperation  at  the  national   level?
How  far  should  governments  go  in   regulating the private sector in the  name of improving cybersecurity?
As governments seek to develop   their  own  national  policies  and  structures  for  cybersecurity,  questions  include:  Which   agency  or  ministry  should  have  the  lead?

Our  focus  is  on  those  crimes  that  use  or  target  computer  networks,  which  we interchangeably refer to as “computer crime,” “cybercrime,” and “network  crime.” Examples of computer crime include computer intrusions, denial of  service attacks, viruses, and worms.
During  the  three years since then, case law developed and, more importantly, Congress  significantly amended the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
We  may  update  the  electronic  version  periodically  and  we  advise  prosecutors  and  agents  to  check  the  website’s  version  for  the  latest  developments.
In response, Congress included in the Comprehensive Crime Control Act  of 1984 provisions to address the unauthorized access and use of computers and  computer networks.
Congress  did  this  by  making  it  a  felony  to  access  classified  information  in  a  computer  without  authorization  and  making  it  a  misdemeanor  to  access  financial records or credit histories stored in a financial institution or to trespass  into a government computer.
Even  after  enacting  section  1030,  Congress  continued  to  investigate  problems  associated  with  computer  crime  to  determine  whether  federal  criminal  laws  required  further  revision.
Finally,  Congress also included in the CFAA a provision criminalizing trafficking in  passwords and similar items.
As computer crimes continued to grow in sophistication and as prosecutors  gained experience with the CFAA, the CFAA required further amending, which  Congress did in 1988, 1989, 1990, 1994, 1996, 2001, 2002, and 2008.
The  2008 amendments made the following changes to section 1030:  •	 Eliminated	 the	 requirement	 in	 18	 U.S.C.
§	 1030(a)(2)(C)	 that	 information  must  have  been  stolen  through  an  interstate  or  foreign  communication,  thereby  expanding  jurisdiction  for  cases  involving  theft of information from computers;  •	 Eliminated	 the	 requirement	 in	 18	 U.S.C.
§ 1030(e)(2)  to  the  full  extent  of  Congress’s  commerce  power  by  including  those  computers  used  in  or  affecting  interstate  or  foreign  commerce or communication; and  2    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  •	 Provided	a	mechanism	for	civil	and	criminal	forfeiture	of	property	used	  in or derived from section 1030 violations.
Additional  information  on  some  of  the  more  significant  amendments may be found on the CCIPS website, www.cybercrime.gov.
The current version of the CFAA includes seven types of criminal activity,  outlined in Table 1 below.
However, despite the fact that a  conspiracy charge under section 1030(b) does not require proof of an overt act,  CCIPS recommends using section 371 to charge conspiracies due to the lack  of clarity on penalties.
Summary of CFAA Penalties Offense Obtaining National Security Information Accessing a Computer and Obtaining Information Trespassing in a Government Computer Accessing a Computer to Defraud & Obtain Value Intentionally Damaging by Knowing Transmission Recklessly Damaging by Intentional Access Negligently Causing Damage & Loss by Intentional Access Trafficking in Passwords Extortion Involving Computers * The maximum prison sentences for second convictions are noted in parentheses.
§  1030(e)(2),  is  a  statutory  term of art that has nothing to do with the security of the computer.
Note that the computer must be “used in or affecting”  not  “used  by  the  defendant  in”—that  is,  it  is  enough  that  the  computer  is  connected to the Internet; the statute does not require proof that the defendant  also used the Internet to access the computer or used the computer to access  the Internet.
Several courts have held that using the Internet from a computer is sufficient  to meet this element.
2009)  (“[T]he  latter  two  elements  of  the  section  1030(a)(2)(C)  crime  [obtaining  information  from  a  protected  computer]  will  always  be  met when an individual using a computer contacts or communicates with an  Internet website.”); United States v. Trotter, 478 F.3d 918, 921 (8th Cir.
2007)  (“No additional interstate nexus is required when instrumentalities or channels  of interstate commerce are regulated.”) (internal citations omitted); Paradigm  Alliance,  Inc.  v.  Celeritas Technologies,  LLC,  248  F.R.D.
598,  602  (D.  Kan.   4    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  2008) (“As a practical matter, a computer providing a ‘web-based’ application  accessible through the internet would satisfy the ‘interstate communication’  requirement.”).
Prior to 2008, this definition did not explicitly cover computers that were  not connected to the Internet and that were not used by the federal government  or  financial  institutions.
For  example,  some  state-run  utility  companies  operate computers that are not connected to the Internet for security reasons.
Congress remedied this gap in the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution  Act of 2008 by broadening the definition of “protected computer” to include  computers that “affect” interstate or foreign commerce or communications.
In the USA PATRIOT Act, Congress amended the definition of “protected  computer”  to  make  clear  that  this  term  includes  computers  outside  of  the  United  States  so  long  as  they  affect  “interstate  or  foreign  commerce  or  communication of the United States.” 18 U.S.C.
“Without Authorization” or “Exceeds Authorized Access”  Several of the criminal offenses in the CFAA require that the defendant  access  a  computer  “without  authorization.”  See  18  U.S.C.
Others  require  that  the  defendant  either  access  a  computer “without authorization” or “exceed authorized access.” See 18 U.S.C.
The term “exceeds authorized access” means “to access a computer  with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the  computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter.” 18 U.S.C.
The  legislative  history  of  the  CFAA  reflects  an  expectation  that  persons  who “exceed authorized access” will be insiders (e.g., employees using a victim’s  corporate computer network), while persons who access computers “without  authorization” will typically be outsiders (e.g., hackers).
2479 (discussing section  1030(a)(5), “insiders, who are authorized to access a computer, face criminal   1.
Civil  cases  interpreting  the  authorization  elements  of  CFAA  offenses  have  often  followed  this  insider/outsider  distinction  and  concluded  that  insiders “exceed authorized access,” while outsiders access computers “without  authorization.” However, some courts have diverged from this general approach  and have found that insiders acted “without authorization” in certain civil cases.
The next two subsections discuss the contours of “without authorization” and  “exceeding authorized access” in more detail.
Without Authorization It  is  relatively  easy  to  define  the  universe  of  individuals  who  lack  any  authorization to access a computer.
When someone from this group of people  accesses  the  computer,  the  access  is  necessarily  “without  authorization”  for  purposes  of  the  CFAA.
2d  367 (D. Conn. 2001) (Russian hacker accessed victim company’s computers  without  authorization).
A  more  difficult  question  is  whether  a  person  with  some authorization to access a computer can ever act “without authorization”  with respect to that computer.
The case law on this issue is muddy, but, as  discussed  below,  there  is  growing  consensus  that  such  “insiders”  cannot  act  “without  authorization”  unless  and  until  their  authorization  to  access  the  computer is rescinded.
Prosecutors rarely argue that a defendant accessed a computer “without  authorization” when the defendant had some authority to access that computer.
However, several civil cases have held that defendants lost their authorization  to access computers when they breached a duty of loyalty to the authorizing  parties, even if the authorizing parties were unaware of the breach.
2006); Shurgard   1 Citrin is the leading authority for the position that a breach of the duty of loyalty can    terminate authorization to access a computer, but its interpretation of “without authoriza- tion” may be considered dicta.
§  1030(a)(5)(A)(i) (now § 1030(a)(5)(A)), which did not require proof that the defendant ac- cessed a computer at all, much less that such access occurred without or in excess of authoriza- tion.
Some of these cases further suggest  that such a breach can occur when the user decides to access the computer  for  a  purpose  that  is  contrary  to  the  interests  of  the  authorizing  party.
See,  e.g.,  Citrin,  440  F.3d  at  420  (defendant’s  authorization  to  access  computer  terminated when he resolved to destroy employer’s files); ViChip Corp. v. Lee,  438 F. Supp.
Iowa 2009) (“[T]he determinative  question  is  whether  Artino  breached  his  duty  of  loyalty  to  NCMIC  when  Artino obtained information from NCMIC’s computers.”).
The Citrin/Shurgard line of cases has been criticized by courts adopting the  view that, under the CFAA, an authorized user of a computer cannot access  the  computer  “without  authorization”  unless  and  until  the  authorization  is  revoked.
Most  significantly,  the  Ninth  Circuit  recently  rejected  Citrin’s  interpretation  of  “without  authorization”  and  found  that,  under  the  plain  language of the CFAA, a user’s authorization to access a computer depends on  the actions of the authorizing party and not on the user’s duty of loyalty.
2009) (“It is  the employer’s decision to allow or to terminate an employee’s authorization to  access a computer that determines whether the employee is with or ‘without  authorization.’”).
The court also suggested that Citrin’s reading of the CFAA  is inconsistent with the rule of lenity, which requires courts to construe any  ambiguity in a criminal statute against the government.
when  the person has not received permission to use the computer for any purpose  (such as when a hacker accesses someone’s computer without any permission),  or when the employer has rescinded permission to access the computer and the  defendant uses the computer anyway.” Id.
Several  district  courts  have  also  recently  moved  away  from  the  Citrin/ Shurgard  view  that  a  user  can  lose  authorization  to  access  a  computer  by   F.3d 418 (7th Cir.
2006) (“Plaintiffs do not assert that Citrin accessed a computer without  authorization.”).
After analyzing the § 1030(a)(5)(A)(i) claim that plaintiff actually alleged,  the Seventh Circuit then opined that the defendant had also violated § 1030(a)(5)(A)(ii) (now  § 1030(a)(5)(B)), which did require that the defendant access a computer without authoriza- tion.
The court appears to have been discussing this hypothetical  § 1030(a)(5)(A)(ii) claim when it stated that an employee could lose authorization to access  his employer’s computer by breaching a duty of loyalty to the employer.
These  courts, like the Ninth Circuit, generally hold that an authorized computer user  can never access the computer “without authorization” unless and until the  authorization is rescinded.
2d at 967  (“[A] violation for accessing ‘without authorization’ occurs only where initial  access is not permitted.”).
Exceeding Authorized Access  Based on this recent case law, courts appear increasingly likely to reject the  idea that a defendant accessed a computer “without authorization” in insider  cases—cases where the defendant had some current authorization to access the  computer.
Accordingly, prosecutors should think carefully before charging such  defendants with violations that require the defendants to access a computer  “without  authorization”  and  instead  consider  bringing  charges  under  those  subsections that require proof that the defendant exceeded authorized access.
Several provisions of the CFAA impose criminal liability on a defendant who,  among other things, “exceeds authorized access” when accessing a computer.
The  CFAA  defines  “exceeds  authorized access” as “to access a computer with authorization and to use such  access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not  entitled so to obtain or alter.”2 18 U.S.C.
Accordingly, to prove  that someone has “exceeded authorized access,” prosecutors should be prepared  to present evidence showing (a) how the person’s authority to obtain or alter  information on the computer was limited, rather than absolute, and (b) how  the person exceeded those limitations in obtaining or altering information.
It is relatively easy to prove that a defendant had only limited authority  to  access  a  computer  in  cases  where  the  defendant’s  access  was  limited  by    2 “Viewing material on a computer screen constitutes ‘obtaining’ information under the  CFAA.” Healthcare Advocates, Inc. v. Harding, Earley, Follmer & Frailey, 497 F. Supp.

2003) (website notices); Cont’l Group, Inc. v. KW Prop.
Fla. 2009) (computer access policies); United States  v. Drew,3 259 F.R.D.
In addition, password protection is an implicit (and technological)  limit on access for otherwise authorized users who are not given the password.
However,  courts have split on the question of whether limits on authorized access can  be reasonably inferred from the circumstances in cases where no explicit or  implicit restrictions on access existed.
typically analyzed the scope of a user’s authorization  to access a protected computer on the basis of the expected norms of intended  use or the nature of the relationship established between the computer owner  and the user.”).4  The  most  commonly  litigated  issue  about  “exceeding  authorized  access”  in  reported  opinions  is  whether  a  particular  defendant  exceeded  authorized  access by accessing the computer for an improper purpose.
The cases on this    3 Although United States v. Drew confirms that the government may rely on a website’s  terms of service to establish that a website user exceeded her authorization to access the site,  the district court also held in that case that the CFAA is unconstitutionally vague to the extent  that it permits a defendant to be charged with a misdemeanor violation of § 1030(a)(2)(C)  based on a conscious violation of a website’s terms of service.
2009) (“[I]f any conscious breach of a website’s terms of service is held to be sufficient  by itself to constitute intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or in excess  of authorization, the result will be that section 1030(a)(2)(C) becomes a law ‘that affords too  much discretion to the police and too little notice to citizens who wish to use the [Internet].’”).
4 Note that one author argues that the law would be better off if all “unauthorized access”  cases were based only on code-based restrictions, arguing that “contract-based” restrictions are  harder to define.
Orin S. Kerr, “Cybercrime’s Scope: Interpreting ‘Access’ and ‘Authorization’  in Computer Misuse Statutes,” 78 N.Y.U.
However, this proposal would  essentially read “exceeding authorized access” out of the statute, which the author generally  acknowledges.
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act   9  issue are difficult to untangle, but this argument generally arises in one of three  contexts: (1) the authorizing party has expressly prohibited the defendant from  accessing the computer for the improper purpose; (2) the authorizing party has  expressly prohibited the defendant from using the authorizing party’s data for  the improper purpose but did not condition the defendant’s computer access  on compliance with this prohibition; and (3) the authorizing party did not  expressly prohibit the defendant from using its data for the improper purpose,  but the defendant was acting against the authorizing party’s interests.
Because the authorizing  party  explicitly  imposed  a  purpose-based  limitation  on  the  defendant’s  computer access, a defendant exceeds authorized access when he accesses the  computer for an expressly forbidden purpose.
2010) (“Access to a computer and data that can  be obtained from that access may be exceeded if the purposes for which the  access has been given are exceeded.”); Cont’l Group, Inc. v. KW Prop.
Fla. 2009) (computer access policies  stated that computers were provided “for business use” and were “to be used  solely for the [authorizing party’s] purposes”); United States v. Salum, 257 Fed.
2007)  (officers  could  access  NCIC  system  only  for official business of criminal justice agency); Register.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc.,  126 F. Supp.
It may be more difficult to prove that a defendant exceeded authorized  access in the second category of cases.
In these cases, the authorizing party  has  expressly  prohibited  the  defendant  from  using  the  authorizing  party’s  data for certain purposes, but it did not condition the defendant’s computer  access on compliance with this prohibition.
For example, the defendant might  have  signed  a  confidentiality  agreement  in  which  he  agreed  not  to  use  the  authorizing party’s information for personal gain, but the agreement did not  specifically  prohibit  the  defendant  from  accessing  the  authorizing  party’s  computer  for  that  purpose.
In  essence,  the  authorizing  party  has  explicitly  limited the defendant’s authorization to use information that he might find on  the computer, but it has not imposed the same purpose-based limitations on  the defendant’s authorization to obtain or alter that information.
The CFAA   10    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  provides that a defendant “exceeds authorized access” when he “obtain[s] or  alter[s] information in the computer that [he] is not entitled so to obtain or  alter,” 18 U.S.C.
§ 1030(e)(6), but it does not discuss using the information  in an unauthorized way.
Because of this statutory language, several courts have  concluded that defendants did not “exceed authorized access” when they were  permitted to obtain certain information from the computers, but then used  that information for a specifically forbidden purpose.
2005)  (defendant  was  authorized  to  access  data  on  proprietary  website  but  then  violated agreement not to use the data for certain purposes).
However, at least  one circuit has upheld an “exceeding authorized access” claim in this context.
2001)  (defendant exceeded authorized access by disclosing computer data in violation  of confidentiality agreement).
In these cases, the defendant accessed the computer  within the limits of his authorization but used the computer for a purpose  that was contrary to the implicit interests or intent of the authorizing party.
The case law is divided on whether these facts are sufficient to establish that  the defendant exceeded authorized access.
Some courts have concluded that  the improper purpose, without more, establishes that the defendant exceeded  authorized access.
2d 760,  767 (N.D. Ill. 2009) (“Allegations that an employee e-mailed and downloaded  confidential information for an improper purpose are sufficient to state a claim  that the employee exceeded her authorization.”).
However, a number of recent civil cases have rejected the idea that users  can exceed authorized access within the meaning of section 1030(e)(6) when  they access information that they are authorized to access, even if their access  is  motivated  by  an  implicitly  improper  purpose.

Obtaining National Security Information:   18 U.S.C.
§ 1030(a)(1)  The  infrequently-used  section  1030(a)(1)  punishes  the  act  of  obtaining  national security information without or in excess of authorization and then  willfully providing or attempting to provide the information to an unauthorized  recipient, or willfully retaining the information.
Any  steps  in  investigating  or  indicting  a  case  under  section  1030(a)(1) require the prior approval  of the National Security Division of  the  Department  of  Justice,  through  the  Counterespionage  Section.

Knowingly Access a Computer Without or    A  violation  of  this  section  requires  proof  that  the  defendant  knowingly  accessed a computer without authorization or in excess of authorization.
This  covers both completely unauthorized individuals who intrude into a computer  containing  national  security  information  as  well  as  insiders  with  limited  privileges who manage to access portions of a computer or computer network  to which they have not been granted access.
However, it is worth noting that computers  and computer networks containing national security information will normally  be classified and incorporate security safeguards and access controls of their  own, which should facilitate proving this element.
Please see page 5 for the discussion of access and authorization.
Obtain National Security Information A  violation  of  this  section  requires  that  the  information  obtained  is  national security information, meaning information “that has been determined  by the United States Government pursuant to an Executive Order or statute  to require protection against unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national  defense  or  foreign  relations,  or  any  restricted  data,  as  defined  in  paragraph  y. of section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.” An example of national  security information used in section 1030(a)(1) would be classified information  obtained from a Department of Defense computer or restricted data obtained  from a Department of Energy computer.
Information Could Injure the United States    A violation of this section requires proof that the defendant had reason  to believe that the national security information so obtained could be used to  the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation.
The  fact that the national security information is classified or restricted, along with  proof of the defendant’s knowledge of that fact, should be sufficient to establish  this element of the offense.
Willful Communication, Delivery, Transmission, or Retention A  violation  of  this  section  requires  proof  that  the  defendant  willfully  communicated,  delivered,  or  transmitted  the  national  security  information,  attempted to do so, or willfully retained the information instead of delivering  it to the intended recipient.
This element could be proven through evidence  showing  that  the  defendant  did  any  of  the  following:  (a)  communicated,  delivered,  or  transmitted  national  security  information,  or  caused  it  to  be  communicated, delivered, or transmitted, to any person not entitled to receive  it;  (b)  attempted  to  communicate,  deliver,  or  transmit  national  security  information,  or  attempted  to  cause  it  to  be  communicated,  delivered,  or  transmitted to any person not entitled to receive it; or (c) willfully retained  national security information and failed to deliver it to an officer or employee  of the United States who is entitled to receive it in the course of their official  duties.
As  originally  enacted,  section 1030(a)(1)  provided  that  anyone who knowingly accessed a computer without authorization or in excess  of authorization and obtained classified information “with the intent or reason  to believe that such information so obtained is to be used to the injury of the   14    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  United States, or to the advantage of any foreign nation” was subject to a fine  or imprisonment for not more than ten years for a first offense.
§ 794(a), the statute that prohibits gathering  or delivering defense information to aid a foreign government.
§ 793(e), which  also  provides  a  maximum  penalty  of  ten  years  imprisonment  for  obtaining  from any source certain information connected with the national defense and  thereafter communicating or attempting to communicate it in an unauthorized  manner.
Section  1030(a)(1)  requires  proof  that  the  individual knowingly accessed a computer without or in excess of authority  and  thereby  obtained  national  security  information,  and  subsequently  performed  some  unauthorized  communication  or  other  improper  act  with  that data.
In this way, it focuses not only on the possession of, control over,  or subsequent transmission of the information (as section 793(e) does), but  also  focuses  on  the  improper  use  of  a  computer  to  obtain  the  information  itself.
However, when a person, without authorization or in  excess of authorized access, deliberately accesses a computer, obtains national  security information, and seeks to transmit or communicate that information  to  any  prohibited  person,  prosecutors  should  consider  charging  a  violation  section 1030(a)(1) in addition to considering charging a violation of section  793(e).
§ 1961(1), making  them predicate offenses for prosecutions under the Racketeer Influenced and  Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute.
As a result, any “RICO enterprise”  (which  may  include  terrorist  groups)  that  violates  section 1030(a)(1)  (or  section 1030(a)(5)(A)) can now be prosecuted under the RICO statute.
C.   Accessing a Computer and Obtaining Information:   18 U.S.C.
§ 1030(a)(2) The distinct but overlapping crimes  established  by  the  three  subsections  of  section  1030(a)(2)  punish  the  unauthorized access of different types of  information and computers.
Title  18,  United  States  Code,   Section 1030(a)(2) provides:  Whoever—  (2) intentionally accesses a computer  without  authorization  or  exceeds  authorized  access,  and  thereby  obtains—  (A)  information  contained  in  a  financial  record  of  a  financial  institution,  or  of  a  card  issuer  as defined in section 1602(n) of  title 15, or contained in a file of   1030(a)(2) Summary (Misd.)
Intentionally access a computer 2.  without or in excess of authorization 3.  obtain information 4.  from   financial records of financial institution     or consumer reporting agency            OR the U.S. government   OR a protected computer  (Felony)  5.  committed for commercial advantage or     private financial gain             obtained exceeds $5,000    OR committed in furtherance of any   criminal or tortious act   OR the value of the information   16    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  a consumer reporting agency on a consumer, as such terms are defined  in the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C.
); (B) information from any department or agency of the United States;  or (C) information from any protected computer .
For example, a  computer intrusion into a federal agency’s computer in violation of section  1030(a)(2)(B) might also be covered as information obtained from a “protected  computer” under section 1030(a)(2)(C).
For  example, it may be difficult to measure the harm in dollars where an individual  unlawfully downloads sensitive medical information from a hospital’s computer  or gathers personal data from the National Crime Information Center.
Although  there is no monetary threshold for establishing a misdemeanor offense under  section 1030(a)(2), the value of the information obtained during an intrusion  can elevate the crime to a felony.
Intentionally Access a Computer A violation of this section generally requires that the defendant actually  access a computer without or in excess of authorization, rather than merely  receive  information  that  was  accessed  without  or  in  excess  of  authorization  by  another.
For  example,  if  A  obtains  information  in  violation  of  section  1030(a)(2) and forwards it to B, B has not violated this section, even if B knew  the source of the information.
In  1986,  Congress  changed  the  intent  standard  in  this  section  from  “knowingly”  to  “intentionally”  in  order  to  emphasize  that  “intentional  acts  of unauthorized access—rather than mistaken, inadvertent, or careless ones— are  precisely  what  the  Committee  intends  to  proscribe.”  S.  Rep.  No.
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act   17  designed the “‘intentional’ standard to focus Federal criminal prosecutions on  those whose conduct evinces a clear intent to enter, without proper authorization,  computer files or data belonging to another.” Id.
Without or In Excess of Authorization Please see page 5 for the discussion of access and authorization.
Obtained Information The term “obtaining information” is an expansive one that includes merely  viewing information without downloading or copying a file.
Information stored electronically  can be obtained not only by actual physical theft, but also by “mere observation  of the data.” Id.
“Information”  includes  intangible  goods;  section  1030(a)(2)  therefore  covers conduct not necessarily covered by other statutes.
In the 1996 amendments to section 1030, Congress clarified  that section 1030(a)(2) would “ensure that the theft of intangible information  by the unauthorized use of a computer is prohibited in the same way theft of  physical items are protected.” S. Rep. No.
Target   Department or Agency of the United States Department or agency includes any federal government entity, including   the legislature, judiciary, and all parts of the Executive Branch.
Under case law, a particular entity is considered an agency when the federal  government  exercises  considerable  control  over  it,  or  the  United  States  has  a proprietary interest in the entity.
169, 171  (N.D. Ga. 1975) (“[C]orporation is not an ‘agency’ unless the government has  a substantial proprietary interest in it, or at least exercises considerable control  over operation and policy in the corporation.”); Walton v. Howard, 683 F. Supp.
was not set  up to perform an essential regulatory function, or an essential function in the  operation of the national economy, with the federal government maintaining  primary control of the corporation.
[I]t is not subject to the substantial  federal control that is characteristic of a governmental agency.”).
Whether a company working as a private contractor for the government  constitutes  a  “department  or  agency  of  the  United  States”  for  purposes  of  prosecution under subsection (a)(2)(B) has not been addressed by any court.
However,  the  argument  that  private  contractors  are  intended  to  be  covered  by  this  section  may  be  undercut  by  section  1030(a)(3),  which  includes  language permitting prosecution of trespass into government systems and non- government systems, if “such conduct affects that use by or for the Government  of the United States.” The existence of this language suggests that if Congress  had intended to extend the reach of section 1030(a)(2)(B) beyond computers  owned by the federal government, it would have done so using language it used  elsewhere in section 1030.
Merely  obtaining  information  worth  less  than  $5,000  is  a  misdemeanor, unless committed after a conviction for another offense under  section 1030, in which case the maximum prison term is 10 years.
A violation or attempted violation of section 1030(a)(2) is a  felony if:  •	 •	  •	  committed	for	commercial advantage or private financial gain, committed	in	furtherance	of	any	criminal	or	tortious	act	in	violation	of	 the Constitution or laws of the United States or of any State, or  the	value	of	the	information	obtained	exceeds	$5,000.
Any reasonable method can be used to establish the value of the information  obtained.
For example, the research, development, and manufacturing costs  or the value of the property “in the thieves’ market” can be used to meet the  $5,000 valuation.
Prosecutors should consider whether the defendant manifested intent to  commit a state tort, such as invasion of privacy, at the time the information was  obtained.
Defendants may also argue that, if the statute covered state common law  torts then it would federalize and criminalize all common law torts occurring on  the Internet and usurp state jurisdiction in common law cases.
First, defendants may only be charged under section 1030(a) (2)  when  they  intentionally  accessed  a  computer  without  authorization  or  exceeded authorized access.
Second, the defendant’s access must have been in furtherance of the  tortious act.
Historical Notes Originally, section 1030(a)(2) protected individual privacy by criminalizing  unauthorized access to computerized information and credit records relating  to customers’ relationships with financial institutions.
In 1996, Congress expanded the  scope of the section by adding two subsections that also protected information  on government computers (§ 1030(a)(2)(B)) and computers used in interstate  or foreign communication (§ 1030(a)(2)(C)).
In 1986, Congress changed the scienter requirement from “knowingly” to  “intentionally.” See Pub.
The first reason for the change  was to ensure that only intentional acts of unauthorized access were prohibited,  rather than “mistaken, inadvertent, or careless” acts of unauthorized access.
The second reason for the  change was a concern that the “knowingly” standard “might be inappropriate  for cases involving computer technology.” Id.
The specific concern was that  a  scienter  requirement  of  “knowingly”  might  include  an  individual  “who  inadvertently ‘stumble[d] into’ someone else’s computer file or computer data,”   1.
The Senate Report offered that “[t]he  substitution of an ‘intentional’ standard is designed to focus Federal criminal  prosecutions on those whose conduct evinces a clear intent to enter, without  proper authorization, computer files or data belonging to another.” Id., 1986  U.S.C.C.A.N.
Until  2008,  a  violation  of  section  1030(a)(2)(C)  required  an  actual  interstate or foreign communication.
This  limitation  precluded  prosecution  in  serious  cases  where  sensitive  or  proprietary  information  was  stolen  from  within  a  single  state,  as  is  often  the case with “insider” thefts.
Through the Identity Theft Enforcement and  Restitution Act, Congress deleted the portion of section 1030(a)(2)(C) that  required an interstate or foreign communication.
Accordingly, the government  may  now  prosecute  those  who  steal  information  from  a  computer  without  regard to how or where the criminal gained access to the victim computer, so  long as that computer constitutes a “protected computer.” In such cases, federal  jurisdiction  is  founded  on  the  definition  of  “protected  computer”—such  as  a  computer  owned  by  the  federal  government  or  one  used  in  or  affecting  interstate commerce—in the same way as other parts of section 1030.
§ 1030(a)(3)  Section 1030(a)(3) protects against “trespasses” by outsiders into federal  government computers, even when no information is obtained during such  trespasses.
Intentionally access 2.  without authorization 3.  a nonpublic computer of the U.S.  that was exclusively for the use of  U.S. or was used by or for U.S. 4.  affected U.S. use of computer  1030(a)(3) Summary (Misd.)
Title 18, United States Code, Section 1030(a)(3) provides: Whoever—  (3)  intentionally,  without  authorization  to  access  any  nonpublic  computer of a department or agency of the United States, accesses such  a computer of that department or agency that is exclusively for the use  of the Government of the United States or, in the case of a computer not  exclusively for such use, is used by or for the Government of the United  States and such conduct affects that use by or for the Government of the  United States .
Intentionally Access The meaning of this term under this section is identical to the meaning   under section 1030(a)(2), discussed on page 17.
Without Authorization By requiring that the defendant act without authorization to access the  computer, section 1030(a)(3) does not apply to situations in which employees  merely  exceed  authorized  access  to  computers  in  their  own  department.
Please  see  page  5  for  the  discussion  of  access  without  or  in  excess  of   authorization.
Nonpublic Computer of the United States “Nonpublic”  includes  most  government  computers,  but  not  Internet  servers that, by design, offer services to members of the general public.
For  example, a government agency’s database server is probably “nonpublic,” while  the same agency’s web servers are “public.”   The  computer  must  be  either  owned  or  controlled  by  a  department  or  agency of the United States, or at least used “by or for” the government of the  United States in some capacity.
Almost  any  network  intrusion  will  affect  the  government’s use of its computers because any intrusion potentially affects the  confidentiality and integrity of the government’s network and often requires  substantial  measures  to  assure  the  integrity  of  data  and  the  security  of  the  network.
Section  1030(a)(3)  “defines  as  a  criminal  violation  the  knowing  unauthorized access or use of the system for any unauthorized purpose.” Sawyer  v. Department of Air Force, 31 M.S.P.R.
Notably,  it is not necessary to demonstrate that the intruder obtained any information  from the computer or that the intruder’s trespass damaged the computer.
Historical Notes Congress  added  the  term  “nonpublic”  in  1996,  in  recognition  of  the  occasions  when  a  department  or  agency  authorizes  access  to  some  portions  of  its  systems  by  the  public,  such  as  websites  and  interactive  services.
This  addition  eliminated  the  potential  defense  that  intruders  were  not  “without  authorization  to  access  any  computer”  if  they  had  been  given  authority  to  access websites and other public networked services offered by the government.
By adding the word “nonpublic,” Congress clarified that persons who have no  authority to access nonpublic computers of a department or agency may be  convicted under section 1030(a)(3), even if they are allowed to access publicly  available computers.
During  enactment  of  section 1030(a)(3),  the  Department  of  Justice  expressed  concern  that  the  section  could  be  interpreted  to  require  that  the  offender’s conduct harm the overall operation of the government, which would  be an exceedingly difficult showing for federal prosecutors.
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act   25  E.  Accessing to Defraud and Obtain Value:   18 U.S.C.
Knowingly access a protected      2.  with intent to defraud 3.  access furthered the intended fraud 4.  obtained anything of value,    including use if value exceeded  $5000  Prosecutors may also want to consider charges under the wire fraud statute,  18 U.S.C.
§ 1343, which requires proof of many elements similar to those  needed for section 1030(a)(4) but carries stiffer penalties.
Title 18, United State Code, Section 1030(a)(4) provides: Whoever—  (4) knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a protected computer  without  authorization,  or  exceeds  authorized  access,  and  by  means  of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of  value, unless the object of the fraud and the thing obtained consists only  of the use of the computer and the value of such use is not more than  $5,000 in any 1-year period .
As a result, section  1030(a)(4) includes the requirement, without analogy in the mail and wire  fraud statutes, that computer usage be of a protected computer and without or  in excess of authorization.
Knowingly Access Without or In Excess of Authorization Please see page 5 for the discussion of access and authorization.
When Congress added this subsection in 1986, a Senate cosponsor’s comments  suggested  that  Congress  intended  section  1030(a)(4)  to  punish  attempts  to  steal valuable data and not to punish mere unauthorized access:  The acts of fraud we are addressing in proposed section 1030(a) (4)  are  essentially  thefts  in  which  someone  uses  a  federal  interest computer to wrongly obtain something of value from  another.
Proposed section 1030(a)(4) is intended to reflect  the distinction between the theft of information, a felony, and  mere unauthorized access, a misdemeanor.
The  Senate  Committee Report further emphasizes the fact that section 1030(a)(4) should  apply to those who steal information through unauthorized access as part of  an illegal scheme:  The Committee remains convinced that there must be a clear  distinction  between  computer  theft,  punishable  as  a  felony  [under  this  section],  and  computer  trespass,  punishable  in  the first instance as a misdemeanor.
The element in the new  paragraph (a)(4), requiring a showing of an intent to defraud,  is meant to preserve that distinction, as is the requirement that   1.
Congress also specifically noted that “[t]he scienter requirement for this  subsection, ‘knowingly and with intent to defraud,’ is the same as the standard  used for 18 U.S.C.
Interestingly,  despite having specifically discussed the mail and wire fraud statutes in the  context  of  section  1030(a)(4),  the  Committee  did  not  relate  the  scienter  requirement of the term “to defraud” to the use of the same term in the mail  and wire fraud statutes, leaving open the question of whether the meaning and  proof of “to defraud” is the same for sections 1030(a)(4) and 1029 as it is for  the mail and wire fraud statutes.
Fasulo examined the outer  limits of the phrase “to defraud,” determining that “broad as are the words ‘to  defraud,’ they do not include threat and coercion through fear or force.” Id.
The Supreme Court held that the mail and wire fraud statutes incorporate  the materiality requirement of common-law fraud.
See Neder v. United States,  527  U.S.  1,  22-23  (1999)  (extending  common-law  fraud’s  requirement  of   5 Identical standards apply to the “scheme to defraud” under both the mail and the wire     fraud statutes.
at 24-25  (acknowledging  that  the  common-law  requirements  of  “justifiable  reliance”  and  “damages”  are  clearly  inconsistent  with  and  therefore  have  no  place  in  federal mail and wire fraud statutes which prohibit the “scheme to defraud”  rather than the completed fraud); see also Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547  U.S. 451, 476 (2006).
Wash.  2000), a civil case involving section 1030(a)(4), the court favored an expansive  interpretation of “intent to defraud.” In denying the defendant’s motion to  dismiss, the court held that the word “fraud” as used in section 1030(a)(4)  simply means “wrongdoing” and does not require proof of the common law  elements of fraud.
Shurgard  does not directly address the Supreme Court’s decisions in the mail or wire  fraud contexts, but nevertheless provides some basis for interpreting “fraud” in  its broadest sense (i.e., finding “fraud” when there is evidence of “wrongdoing,”  as opposed to requiring proof of “trick, deceit, chicane, or overreaching”).
However, merely browsing information which does not produce anything  of value does not qualify as a “scheme to defraud.” United States v. Czubinski,  106  F.3d  1069  (1st  Cir.
1997)  (defendant’s  unauthorized  browsing  of  confidential  taxpayer  information  in  which  he  did  not  obtain  “anything  of  value” did not constitute the statutory crime of computer fraud because he  did not defraud Internal Revenue Service of its property within meaning of 18  U.S.C.
Access Furthered the Intended Fraud The defendant’s illegal access of the protected computer must “further” a  fraud.
Accessing a computer without authorization—or, more often, exceeding  authorized access—can further a fraud in several ways.
•	 This	 element	 is	 met	 if	 a	 defendant	 obtains	 information	 from	 a	 computer and then later uses that information to commit fraud.
2001)  (unpublished), the defendant accessed a telephone company’s computer  without authorization, obtained calling card numbers, and then used  those calling card numbers to make free long-distance telephone calls.
See  United  States  v.  McNeive,  536  F.2d 1245, 1248-49 (1976) (listing cases covered under mail and wire fraud  statutes, including false insurance claims, cheating investors, false odometer  schemes, and check kiting schemes).
1981)  (employer’s interest in confidential information); United States v. Bronston, 658  F.2d 920, 927 (2d Cir.
§ 1346 (expanding the definition of scheme or artifice to defraud in  both the mail and wire fraud statutes to include schemes to deprive individuals  of “honest services”).
Some schemes involve not only fraud, but also the theft and alteration of  confidential information through unauthorized access of computers.
denied, 498  U.S. 1069 (1991) (holding that defendants were in violation of section 1343  for  accessing  American  Airlines’  computer  reservation  system  and  altering  information therein); United States v. Riggs, 739 F. Supp.
414 (N.D. Ill. 1990)  (holding that defendants were in violation of section 1343 when they gained  unauthorized access to Bell South’s emergency computer file and schemed to  defraud Bell South of property).
The term “by means of such conduct” explicitly links the unauthorized  accessing  of  a  protected  computer  to  the  furthering  of  the  intended  fraud.
Obtains Anything of Value This  element  is  easily  met  if  the  defendant  obtained  money,  cash,  or  a  good or service with measurable value.
Two cases that are more difficult arise  (1) when the defendant obtains only the use of a computer, and (2) when the  defendant obtains only information.
Data or information as a thing of value Aside  from  the  “computer  use”  exception,  subsection  (a)(4)  has  no  minimum dollar amount.
Still, the legislative history suggests that obtaining  some computer data or information, alone, is not valuable enough to qualify.
2479, 2487) (“In  intentionally  trespassing  into  someone  else’s  computer  files,  the  offender  obtains at the very least information as to how to break into that computer  system.
One  case  involving  the  mere  viewing  of  information  is  United  States  v.  Czubinski,  106  F.3d  1069  (1st  Cir.
While  Czubinski  turned  on  its  specific facts and was decided before Congress amended section 1030(a)(2)  to cover obtaining information from a department or agency of the United  States,  the  court’s  discussion  may  be  instructive  in  assessing  the  parameters  of the term “something of value.” Specifically, Czubinski was employed as a  Contact Representative in the Boston office of the Taxpayer Services Division   32    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
As part of his official duties, Czubinski  routinely accessed taxpayer-related information from an IRS computer system  using a valid password provided to Contact Representatives.
Despite IRS rules  plainly forbidding employees from accessing taxpayer files outside the course  of their official duties, Czubinski carried out numerous unauthorized searches  of taxpayer records on a number of occasions.
On  appeal,  Czubinski  argued  that  his  conviction  for  violating  section  1030(a)(4) should be overturned because he did not obtain “anything of value.”  In reviewing the facts surrounding Czubinski’s actions, the First Circuit agreed  with  Czubinski,  stating  that  “[t]he  value  of  information  is  relative  to  one’s  needs and objectives; here, the government had to show that the information  was valuable to Czubinski in light of a fraudulent scheme.
Further elaborating on its holding, the court went on to explain that:   [t]he  plain  language  of  section  1030(a)(4)  emphasizes  that  more  than  mere  unauthorized  use  is  required:  the  “thing  obtained” may not merely be the unauthorized use.
It is the  showing of some additional end—to which the unauthorized  access is a means—that is lacking here.
The evidence did not  show that Czubinski’s end was anything more than to satisfy his  curiosity by viewing information about friends, acquaintances,  and political rivals.
No evidence suggests that he printed out,  recorded,  or  used  the  information  he  browsed.
No  rational  jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Czubinski  intended  to  use  or  disclose  that  information,  and  merely  viewing information cannot be deemed the same as obtaining  something of value for the purposes of this statute.
Specifically,  America Online (AOL) was sued by computer users and competitor Internet  service  providers,  alleging  that  AOL’s  software  had  caused  damage  to  users’   6 As a result of a statutory amendment, Czubinski’s conduct could now be charged as a     violation of subsection 1030(a)(2) (exceeding authorized access and obtaining information).
AOL’s alleged end is to obtain a monopoly, or at least secure its stronghold, as  an ISP.” America Online at 1379-80.

34    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  F.  Damaging a Computer or Information:   18 U.S.C.
Intentionally access a  protected computer  without authorization  2.  recklessly cause damage  1.
Intentionally access a  protected computer  without authorization  2.  cause damage 3.  cause loss  1.
Knowingly cause  transmission of a  program, information,  code, or command 2.  intentionally cause   damage to protected  computer without  authorization  Felony   OR  3.  resulting in loss of $5,000 during 1 year     modifies medical care of a person             OR causes physical injury  OR threatens public health or safety  OR damages systems used by or for government entity for  administration of justice, national defense, or national security  OR damages affect 10 or more protected computers during 1 year  Criminals  can  cause  damage  to  computers  in  a  wide  variety  of  ways.
For example, an intruder who gains unauthorized access to a computer can  send commands that delete files or shuts the computer down.
Intruders can  initiate a “denial of service attack” that floods the victim computer with useless  information and prevents legitimate users from accessing it.
A virus or worm  can  use  up  all  of  the  available  communications  bandwidth  on  a  corporate  network, making it unavailable to employees.
When a virus or worm penetrates  a computer’s security, it can delete files, crash the computer, install malicious  software, or do other things that impair the computer’s integrity.
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act   35  Title 18, United State Code, Section 1030(a)(5) provides: Whoever—  (5)(A) knowingly causes the transmission of a program, information,  code, or command, and as a result of such conduct, intentionally causes  damage without authorization, to a protected computer; (B) intentionally accesses a protected computer without authorization,  and as a result of such conduct, recklessly causes damage; or (C) intentionally accesses a protected computer without authorization,  and as a result of such conduct, causes damage and loss .
For example, a business may not be  able to operate if its computer system stops functioning or it may lose sales  if it cannot retrieve the data in a database containing customer information.
Such damage to a computer can occur following  a successful intrusion, but it may also occur in ways that do not involve the  unauthorized access of a computer system.
The  differences  between  the conduct criminalized by the three subsections of section 1030(a)(5) vary  depending on the mental state of the attackers and their ability to access the  victim  computer.
The latter two subsections require that the defendant “access” the computer  without authorization.
By  contrast,  section 1030(a)(5)(A)  requires  proof  only  of  the  knowing  transmission  of  data,  a  command,  or  software  to  intentionally  damage  a  computer  without  authorization.
The  government  does  not  need  to  prove  “access.” Because it is possible to damage a computer without “accessing” it,  this element is easier to prove (except for the mental state requirement).
For  example, where an attacker floods an Internet connection with data during a  denial of service attack, the damage is intentional even though the attacker  never accesses the site.
The Transmission or Access Element  Subsection (a)(5)(A): Knowingly causing the transmission of a program,  information, code, or command to a protected computer  Section 1030(a)(5)(A) prohibits knowingly causing the transmission of a  “program, information, code, or command” and as a result of such conduct,  intentionally causing damage to a protected computer.
This subsection applies  equally to offenders who are authorized to use the victim computer system (an  “insider”), to those not authorized to use it (an “outsider”), and to those who  have never accessed the system at all.
The term “program, information, code, or command” broadly covers all  transmissions that are capable of having an effect on a computer’s operation.
This includes software code (such as a worm), software commands (such as an  instruction to delete information), and network packets designed to flood a  network connection or exploit system vulnerabilities.
An attacker need not directly send the required transmission to the victim  computer  in  order  to  violate  this  statute.
In  one  case,  a  defendant  inserted  malicious  code  into  a  software  program  he  wrote  to  run  on  his  employer’s  computer  network.

2006), the Seventh Circuit held that a civil complaint stated  a claim when it alleged that the defendant copied a secure-erasure program to  his (company-issued) laptop, and even said in dicta that it made no difference  if  the  defendant  copied  the  program  over  an  Internet  connection,  from  an  external  disk  drive,  or  an  internal  disk  drive.
Similarly,  in  Shaw  v. Toshiba  America Information Systems, 91 F. Supp.
Id.7  Subsections (a)(5)(B) or (C): Intentionally accessed a protected computer  without authorization  Subsections  1030(a)(5)(B)  and  (C)  require  proof  that  the  defendant  intentionally  accessed  a  protected  computer  without  authorization.
These  subsections do not include the phrase “exceeds authorized access.” Compare 18  U.S.C.
Please see page 5 for the discussion of access without authorization.
The statute requires only that the defendant’s conduct  “cause” damage in a computer.
It is not necessary to prove that the damaged  computer was the same computer that the defendant accessed.
First,  “damage”  occurs  when  an  act  impairs  the  “integrity”  of  data,  a  program, a system, or information.
This part of the definition would apply,  for example, where an act causes data or information to be deleted or changed,  such as where an intruder accesses a computer system and deletes log files or  changes entries in a bank database.
Damage  also  occurs  if  an  intruder  alters  the security software of a victim computer so that it fails to detect computer  trespassers.
In addition to the impairment of the integrity of information or computer  systems, the definition of damage also includes acts that simply make information  or computers “unavailable.” Intruders have devised ways to consume all of a  computer’s  computational  resources,  effectively  making  it  impossible  for  authorized users to make use of the computer even though none of the data  or software on the victim computer has been modified.
Similarly, a “denial  of service attack” can flood a computer’s Internet connection with junk data,  preventing legitimate users from sending or receiving any communications with  that computer.
2d 870, 871 (N.D.  Ill. 2000) (granting temporary restraining order where defendant installed code  on plaintiff’s web server that diverted certain users trying to access plaintiff’s  website to pornography website).
Example  1:  Prior  to  the  annual  football  game  between  rival  schools,  an  intruder from one high school gains access to the computer system of a rival  school and defaces the football team’s website with graffiti announcing that the  intruder’s school was going to win the game.
In  this  example,  the  intruder  has  caused  damage—the  integrity  of  the  information on the website has been impaired because viewers of the site will  not see the information that the site’s designers put there.
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act   39  Example 2: An attacker configures several thousand computers to access the  washingtonpost.com website at the same time in a coordinated denial of service  attack.
A  computer  network  intrusion—even  a  fairly  noticeable  one—can  amount to a kind of trespass that causes no readily discoverable impairment  to the computers intruded upon or the data accessed.
Even so, such “trespass  intrusions”  often  require  that  substantial  time  and  attention  be  devoted  to  responding to them.
In addition, holes exploited by the intruder are  sometimes patched, and the network generally is resecured through a rigorous  and time-consuming technical effort.
It appears to the administrator that  the intruder accessed a student database that listed students’ home addresses,  phone numbers, and social security numbers.
Still, the result of the technical review  is that no offending code can be found, and the network appears to function  as before.
Although  the  intruder  apparently  did  not  make  any  alterations  to  the  database and the system seems to work as it did before, in a few civil cases  courts have held that accessing and copying private data may cause damage to  the data under the CFAA.8 See Shurgard Storage Centers, Inc. v. Safeguard Self  Storage, Inc., 119 F. Supp.
The court, however, found the term “integrity” contextually  ambiguous and held that the employee did in fact impair the integrity of the  data on the system—even though no data was “physically changed or erased”  in the process—when he accessed a computer system without authorization to  collect trade secrets.
Courts  have  made  similar  rulings  in  HUB  Group,  Inc.  v.  Clancy,  2006  WL 208684 (E.D.
Pa. 2006) (downloading employer’s customer database to  a thumb drive for use at a future employer created sufficient damage to state  claim under the CFAA), and I.M.S. Inquiry Management Systems v. Berkshire  Information Systems, 307 F. Supp.
Loss For section 1030(a)(5)(C) violations only, the statute also requires that the  defendant’s conduct cause “loss,” which the statute defines as “any reasonable  cost to any victim, including the cost of responding to an offense, conducting  a damage assessment, and restoring data, program, system, or information to  its condition prior to the offense, and any revenue lost, cost incurred, or other  consequential damages incurred because of interruption of service.” 18 U.S.C.
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act   41  physical injury to a person; (4) a threat to public health or safety; (5) damage to  a computer used in the administration of justice, national defense, or national  security; or (6) damage affecting ten or more protected computers during any  one-year period.
Loss includes  Under  prior  iterations  of  the  statute,  the  government  had  to  prove  a  defendant’s conduct resulted in one of the first five harms listed above in order  to prove a section 1030(a)(5) violation.
Response costs Damage assessments Restoration of data or programs Wages of employees for these tasks Lost sales from website Lost advertising revenue from website  Harm to reputation or goodwill Other costs if reasonable  Assistance to law enforcement  In   the   Loss might include  Loss does not include  In addition, under the 2008 amendment, causing damage to ten or more  computers became a sixth circumstance in which a violation of section 1030(a) (5)(A)  or  (B)  constitutes  a  felony.
The  statute defines “loss” quite broadly: “any reasonable cost to any victim, including  the cost of responding to an offense, conducting a damage assessment, and  restoring data, program, system, or information to its condition prior to the  offense, and any revenue lost, cost incurred, or other consequential damages  incurred because of interruption of service.” 18 U.S.C.
This  definition includes, for example, the prorated salary of a system administrator  who restores a backup of deleted data, the prorated hourly wage of an employee  who checks a database to make sure that no information in it has been modified,   42    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  the expense of re-creating lost work, the cost of reinstalling system software,  and the cost of installing security measures to resecure the computer to avoid  further  damage  from  the  offender.
1996) (in calculating “loss” for  purposes of earlier version of sentencing guidelines, court properly included  standard hourly rate for employees’ time, computer time, and administrative  overhead); see also I.M.S. Inquiry Management Systems v. Berkshire Information  Systems, 307 F. Supp.
2004) (awarding costs related to  “damage assessment and remedial measures”).
“Loss” also includes such harms as lost advertising revenue or lost sales due  to a website outage and the salaries of company employees who are unable to  work due to a computer shutdown.
2004)  (suggesting, under pre-2001 version of § 1030(a)(5), that lost goodwill and  lost profits could properly be included in loss calculations where they result  from damage to a computer).
However, the cost of installing completely new  security measures “unrelated to preventing further damage resulting from [the  offender’s] conduct,” should not be included in the loss total.
2001) (cost of hiring outside consultant to  analyze damage “solely in preparation of litigation” may not be included in  loss calculation (based on pre-amendment statutory text)).
Prosecutors should  think creatively about what sorts of harms in a particular situation meet this  definition and work with victims to measure and document all of these losses.
2001) (stating that America Online is “unpersuasive” and that reputation and  goodwill “seem[] far removed from the damage Congress sought to punish and  remedy—namely, damage to computer systems and electronic information by  intruders”).
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act   43  “Loss” calculations may not include costs incurred by victims primarily  to aid the government in prosecuting or investigating an offense.
In meeting the $5,000 loss requirement, the government may aggregate  all of the losses to all of the victims of a particular intruder that occur within a  one-year period, so long as the losses result from a “related course of conduct.”  Thus,  evidence  showing  that  a  particular  intruder  broke  into  a  computer  network five times and caused $1,000 loss each time would meet the statutory  requirement, as would $1 loss to 5,000 computers caused by the release of a  single virus or worm.9 In addition, section 1030(e)(12) makes clear that for  purposes of establishing loss, the victim can be any natural or legal “person,”  including corporations, government agencies, or other legal entities.10  The statute does not impose a proximate causation requirement on loss or  any other of the special harms listed in section 1030(c)(4)(A)(i).
9 Prior to the 2001 amendments, numerous courts struggled with the question of wheth- er and how loss to several victims could be aggregated to meet the $5,000 loss requirement.
2000) (rejecting defendant’s argu- ment that “individuals” did not include corporations).
In 2001, Congress changed the word  “individuals” to “persons” and added a broad definition of “person” that includes corpora- tions, government agencies, and any “legal or other entity.” 18 U.S.C.
This  subsection  provides  strong  protection  to  the  computer networks of hospitals, clinics, and other medical facilities because of  the importance of those systems and the sensitivity of the data that they contain.
This type of harm does not require any showing of financial loss.
This damage prevents medical personnel from logging  on to the computer system, making it impossible to access patients’ electronic  medical records, charts, and other data.
Even though nothing harmful actually occurred as a consequence  of the impairment to the system in this case, it requires little imagination to  conjure a different outcome where the inability to access the computer system  would affect a doctor or nurse’s ability to treat a patient.
Computer  networks control many vital systems in our society, such as air traffic control  and 911 emergency telephone service.
Although the statute does not explicitly require  that the injury be proximately caused, courts have much experience in applying  this sort of test in other areas of the law and might import the doctrine here.
For example, suppose that an intruder succeeds in accessing an electric utility’s  computer system and shuts down power to a three-square-block area, causing  the traffic lights to shut down, and a car accident results.
Threats to Public Health or Safety The fourth specified harm is closely related to physical injury, but only  requires a “threat” to public health or safety.
Today,  computer networks control many of the nation’s critical infrastructures, such  as  electricity  and  gas  distribution,  water  purification,  nuclear  power,  and  transportation.
Damage to the computers that operate these systems or their  control and safety mechanisms can create a threat to the safety of many people  at once.
Justice, National Defense, or National Security    The specified harm requirement can also be satisfied if the damage affects  “a computer system used by or for a government entity in furtherance of the  administration  of  justice,  national  defense,  or  national  security.”  18  U.S.C.
In  2001,  Congress  added  this  subsection  because  this  sort  of  damage  can  affect  critically  important  functions—such  as  one  intruder’s attempt to access a court computer without authority and change his  sentence—but may not be easily quantified in terms of economic loss under  section 1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(I).
Here, “the administration of justice” includes court system computers, but  would also appropriately extend to computers owned by state or federal law  enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and probation offices.
national  defense,  or  national  security”  would  include most computer networks owned by the Department of Defense.
The  statutory language does not require that the computer be owned or operated  by the government—computers owned by a defense contractor, for example,   46    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  could be “used .
for” the military in furtherance of national security.
Penalties If  an  offender  accesses  a  computer  without  authorization  and  causes  damage  and  loss  with  no  culpable  mental  state  (i.e.,  accidentally  or  negligently), he commits a violation of section 1030(a)(5)(C).
Relation to Other Statutes In  many  cases,  intruders  cause  damage  to  systems  even  though  their  primary  intent  is  to  steal  information  or  commit  a  fraud  in  violation  of  sections 1030(a)(2) or (a)(4).
For example, intruders commonly try to make  it difficult for system administrators to detect them by erasing log files that  show that they accessed the computer network.
Similarly, intruders  commonly  modify  system  programs  or  install  new  programs  to  circumvent  the computer’s security so that they can access the computer again later.
This  activity impairs the integrity of the computer and its programs and therefore  meets the damage requirement.
For example, where the criminal act causes  damage to a computer for communications that is “operated or controlled by  the United States” or is “used or intended to be used for military or civil defense  functions,” prosecutors should consider charging 18 U.S.C.
Other potentially applicable statutes are discussed in Chapter 3, “Other  Network Crime Statutes.”  G.  Trafficking in Passwords: 18 U.S.C.
§ 1030(a)(6)  Section 1030(a)(6) prohibits a person from knowingly and with intent to  defraud trafficking in computer passwords and similar information when the  trafficking affects interstate or foreign commerce, or when the password may be  used to access without authorization a  computer  used  by  or  for  the  federal  government.
Title  18,  United  States  Code,   Section 1030(a)(6) provides:  information  3.  knowingly and with intent to     defraud 4.  trafficking affects interstate or foreign   Whoever— (6)  Knowingly  and  with  intent  to  defraud  traffics  (as  defined  in  section  1029)  in  any  password  or  similar information through which a computer may be accessed without  authorization, if—  commerce   OR  computer used by or for U.S.       (A) such trafficking affects interstate or foreign commerce; or (B)  such  computer  is  used  by  or  for  the  Government  of  the  United  States .
§ 1029, which means “transfer, or  otherwise dispose of, to another, or obtain control of with intent to transfer  or  dispose  of.”  18  U.S.C.
A  profit  motive  is  not  required.
Similarly,  personal  use  of  an unauthorized password is not a violation of section 1030(a)(6), although  it  may  be  a  violation  of  other  provisions  under  section  1030  that  apply  to  unauthorized access to computers or of section 1029.
Computer Password or Similar Information The  term  “password”  does  not  mean  just  a  single  word  or  phrase  that  enables one to access a computer.
As a Senate report noted, the statute prohibits  trafficking in passwords or similar information:  The Committee recognizes that a “password” may actually be  comprised  of  a  set  of  instructions  or  directions  for  gaining  access  to  a  computer  and  intends  that  the  word  “password”  be construed broadly enough to encompass both single words  and longer more detailed explanations on how to access others’  computers.
Therefore, prosecutors should apply the term “password” using a broad  meaning to include any instructions that safeguard a computer.
However, courts have typically   50    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  construed this requirement expansively when interpreting other statutes that  require a certain conduct to affect interstate or foreign commerce.
Computer Used By or For the U.S. Government To prove a violation of subsection (B), the password or similar information  must be for accessing without authorization a computer “used by or for the  Government of the United States.” This phrase, which is also used in section  1030(a)(3)), is not defined by statute or case law, but its plain meaning should  encompass any computer used for official business by a federal government  employee or on behalf of the federal government.
Relation to Other Statutes Given the shared statutory definition, section 1030(a)(6) cases often overlap  with access device cases under section 1029.
Passwords are also access devices  under section 1029.
1993) (holding that the plain meaning of the term “access device”  covers  “stolen  and  fraudulently  obtained  passwords  which  may  be  used  to  access computers to wrongfully obtain things of value”).
For more information  on section 1029, see Chapter 3, “Other Network Crime Statutes.”    7.
Historical Notes Congress enacted section 1030(a)(6) in 1986 as a “misdemeanor offense  aimed  at  penalizing  conduct  associated  with  ‘pirate  bulletin  boards,’  where  passwords are displayed that permit unauthorized access to others’ computers.”  S.  Rep.  No.
With intent to extort money or any   other thing of value  2.  transmits in interstate or foreign   commerce a communication  3. containing a:         threat to damage a protected  computer   OR threat to obtain or reveal confidential  information without or in excess of  authorization   OR      demand or request for money or   value in relation to damage done in  connection with the extortion.
Title 18, United States Code, Section 1030(a)(7) provides: Whoever— (7) with intent to extort from any person any money or other thing of value,  transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing  any—  (A) threat to cause damage to a protected computer; (B)  threat  to  obtain  information  from  a  protected  computer  without authorization or in excess of authorization or to impair the  confidentiality  of  information  obtained  from  a  protected  computer  without authorization or by exceeding authorized access; or  (C) demand or request for money or other thing of value in relation  to damage to a protected computer, where such damage was caused to  facilitate the extortion;   shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this section.
Rather, the statute covers  “any  interstate  or  international  transmission  of  threats  against  computers,  computer networks, and their data and programs where the threat is received  by mail, a telephone call, electronic mail, or through a computerized messaging  service.” S. Rep. No.
Unlawful threats to cause  damage include threats to interfere in any way with the normal operation of  the computer or system in question, including denying access to authorized  users, erasing or corrupting data or programs, or slowing down the operation  of the computer or system.
In contrast, unlawful threats to the business that owns the  computer system, such as threats to reveal flaws in the network or to reveal that  the network has been hacked, are not threats to damage a protected computer  under section 1030(a)(7).
Threat to Obtain or Disclose Confidential Information Section  1030(a)(7)(B)  covers  two  different  scenarios.
In  the  first,  the  criminal threatens to steal confidential information from the victim’s computer  systems unless his demands are met.
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act   53  obtained information by exceeding his authorization or accessing the victim’s  computers  without  authorization  and  threatens  to  disclose  this  previously  obtained information unless the victim complies with his demands.
For  example, the criminal may access the victim’s computer system, encrypt data,  and then demand money for the decryption key.
However, in contrast to section 1951, section 1030(a)(7)  does not require proof that the defendant delayed or obstructed commerce.
2d 367 (D. Conn. 2001), the defendant  hacked into the victim’s network and obtained root access to the victim’s servers.
He then proposed that the victim hire him as a “security expert” to prevent  further security breaches, including the deletion of all of the files on the server.
It is not entirely clear that existing extortion  statutes,  which  protect  against  physical  injury  to  persons  or  property, will cover intangible computerized information.
875(d)  (interstate  communication of a threat to injure the property of another),  does not clearly include the operation of a computer, the data  or programs stored in a computer or its peripheral equipment,  or the decoding keys to encrypted data.
(2) The criminal forfeiture of property under this subsection, any seizure  and disposition thereof, and any judicial proceeding in relation thereto,  shall be governed by the provisions of section 413 of the Comprehensive  Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C.
2006) (“[O]ur cases  require that proceeds forfeitures be of net, not gross, proceeds and that while  restitution  is  loss  based,  forfeiture  is  gain  based.”);  United  States  v.  Masters,  924 F.2d 1362, 1369-1370 (7th Cir.

It became a useful computer crime statute in 1986, when Congress  amended it to explicitly cover “electronic communications”—a broad term that  includes computer network communications.
For  more  on  law  enforcement’s  access  to  information  concerning  communications,  see  U.S.  Department  of  Justice, Searching and Seizing Computers and Obtaining Electronic Evidence in Criminal Inves- tigations (Office of Legal Education 2009).
Accordingly, section 2511(1)(b) generally will not apply to network intrusions, which  almost always involve electronic communications, and that section is not discussed here.
Intentional 2.  interception (or endeavoring or  procuring another to intercept)  3.  of the contents 4.  of a wire, oral or electronic   communication  5.  by use of a device.
However,  embedded  in  the  definitions  are  additional  requirements  that  indictments  and  jury  instructions  also  frequently  include:  specifically,  the  requirements that an interception be done with a “device,” and that it be done  contemporaneously with transmission.
Defendants  sometimes  argue  that  they  lacked  the  required  mental  state  because they believed that their interception was lawful.
Before the change, some courts had held that  the old “willfully” standard meant that the jury could consider “evidence that  the accused acted or failed to act because of ignorance of the law” as ignorance  of the law was relevant to “whether or not the accused acted or failed to act  with specific intent.” United States v. Schilleci, 545 F.2d 519, 523-24 (5th Cir.
Wiretap Act   61  (intent requirement “does not, however, require any intent to violate the law,  or even any knowledge that the interception would be illegal”).
Additionally, a majority of  courts have read into the definition of “intercept” a requirement that does not  appear in the text of the statute—that the “acquisition” of the communication  be “contemporaneous” with the transmission of the communication.
The court rejected the argument, holding that “an ‘interception’  requires, at the least, involvement in the initial use of the device contemporaneous  with the communication to transmit or preserve the communication.” Turk,  526 F.2d at 658 n.3.
An individual who obtains access to a stored copy of the communication left  behind after the communication reached its destination does not “intercept”  the  communication.
1994)  (access  to  stored  email  communications); Fraser v. Nationwide Mut.
However,  the  First  Circuit  has  suggested  that  the  contemporaneity  requirement, which was developed during the era of telephone wiretaps, “may  not be apt to address issues involving the application of the Wiretap Act to  electronic communications.” United States v. Councilman, 418 F.3d 67, 79-80  (1st Cir.
Ohio Feb. 14, 2007) (finding “substantial likelihood” that the Sixth  Circuit will find the contemporaneity requirement does not apply to electronic  communications).
2010), the Seventh Circuit stated that “[t]here is no timing requirement  in the Wiretap Act, and judges ought not add to statutory definitions.” Id.
It stated that acquisition of a stored voice message would fall within  the definition of “interception,” and that “[u]nder the statute, any acquisition  of  information  using  a  device  is  an  interception.”  Id.
Consequently, despite  Szymuszkiewicz, prosecutors are advised to charge Wiretap Act violations only  when the contemporaneity requirement is present.
By contrast, the First Circuit held the  contemporaneity  requirement  could  be  read  simply  to  exclude  acquisitions  “made  a  substantial  amount  of  time  after  material  was  put  into  electronic  storage.”  In  re  Pharmatrak,  Inc.  Privacy  Litigation,  329  F.3d  9,  21  (1st  Cir.
Two of the three judges held that email messages acquired from a computer’s  random access memory or hard disk were not intercepted “contemporaneously”  with  transmission.
In  practice,  prosecutors  should  assume  that  the  “contemporaneous”  element applies.
However, if  a defendant appears to have simply accessed a computer system and obtained  previously  stored  copies  of  a  message,  then  the  defendant  might  not  have  violated  the Wiretap  Act.
§  1030(a)(2),  which  prohibits  accessing  a  protected  computer  and  obtaining information, or the lesser-used 18 U.S.C.
§ 2701, which prohibits  access to certain communications residing on the computers of an electronic  communication service provider.
“‘[C]ontents’, when used with respect  to  any  wire,  oral,  or  electronic  communication,  includes  any  information  concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of that communication.” 18  U.S.C.
Obtaining  this non-“content” information about a communication might, however, be a  misdemeanor violation of the prohibition on pen registers and trap and trace  devices.
Some types of information concerning network communications, such as  full-path URLs, may raise arguments about whether they contain content.
We  encourage prosecutors who have questions about whether a particular type of  information constitutes “contents” under the Wiretap Act to contact CCIPS  for assistance at (202) 514-1026.
2005) (prohibition on interception of  “oral communications” includes sound track of a video recording).
“Electronic”  communications are most every other type of communication sent using the  electronic spectrum, including computer network communications that do not  contain the human voice.
The definitions of “wire communication” and “electronic communication”  both require that the “communication” be sent using a facility or system that  affects interstate or foreign commerce.
Although  this  does  not  require  that  the  communication  actually  travel  interstate,  it  does  exclude  some  purely  local  communications.
For  example,  “an  internal  communication device that physically resembles a telephone handset,” used  to  allow  prisoners  to  communicate  with  visitors,  did  not  qualify  because  it  was “not connected to any facility capable of transmitting interstate or foreign  communications.” United States v. Peoples, 250 F.3d 630, 636 (8th Cir.
The  Internet  easily  meets  the  definition  of  a  facility  or  system  that  affects   66    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  interstate  or  foreign  commerce.
2007) (“As both the means to engage in commerce and the  method by which transactions occur, ‘the Internet is an instrumentality and  channel of interstate commerce.’”).
Defendants  sometimes  attempt  to  argue  that  the  communication  they  intercepted did not meet this interstate commerce requirement because the  particular leg of the communication that they intercepted was intrastate.
For  instance, a defendant has claimed that his device that acquired transfers between  a keyboard and a computer did not acquire any electronic communications.
Notwithstanding  the  Ropp  decision,  prosecutors  should  pursue  cases  involving interceptions occurring on computers or internal networks that affect  interstate commerce.
For example, if an individual installs malicious software  on the victim’s computer that makes a surreptitious copy every time an email is  sent, or captures such messages as they move on the local area network on their  way to their ultimate destination halfway around the world, such cases can be  prosecuted under section 2511.
A transfer should include all transmission of the communication  from  the  originator  to  the  recipient.
Similarly,  the  Senate  Report  discusses  the  inclusion  of  communications  on  private  networks  and  intracompany communications systems.
Use of a Device Under  the  Wiretap  Act,  an  “interception”  must  occur  by  means  of  an  “[e]lectronic,  mechanical  or  other  device.”  18  U.S.C.
Generally,  “‘electronic, mechanical or other device’ means any device or apparatus which  can be used to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication,” subject to  two exceptions discussed below.
Even though the “device”  language is not contained in section 2511(1)(a) itself, but in the definition of  “interception,”  some  courts  have  treated  it  as  an  independent  element  of  a  section 2511(1)(a) violation.
Congress  included  the  “device”  requirement  in  the  statute  in  order  to  eliminate from its scope the plain, unaided use of natural human senses to  obtain the contents of a communication.
When wire  or electronic communications are intercepted, the use of a “device” is implicit;  there is simply no way to obtain the contents of a radio transmission without  using a radio, or to obtain the contents of a computer network transmission  without a computer.
In a typical network crime, the “device” is a computer used  to intercept the communication or a software program running on a computer.
Each satisfies the statutory requirements.
Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 940 (2005) (in a  copyright inducement civil case, referring to software as a “device”).
In its definition of “device,” the statute excludes three categories from its  scope.
The  statute  eliminates “a hearing aid or similar device being used to correct subnormal  hearing to not better than normal.” 18 U.S.C.
These non-“devices” must be used “by the subscriber  or user,” not by an interloper.
Wiretap Act   69  a person who uses a telephone to talk with someone else would be engaging in  an “interception” of his own conversation because he “acquires” its “contents”  using a “device;” this exemption removes a subscriber’s own telephone from the  definition of “device.” (Even without this exemption, such an “interception”  likely would be lawful under the consent exception, discussed below).

On top of the ambiguities concerning the contours of this carve-out that  arise  from  the  definition  of  device,  it  is  not  at  all  clear  that  this  exception  would transfer to the network crime context.
Indeed, the premise of Title III is that there is  nothing ‘ordinary’ about the use of a device to capture communications for  investigative purposes.” Id.
As Chief Judge Posner explained:  Investigation is within the ordinary course of law enforcement,  so  if  “ordinary”  were  read  literally  warrants  would  rarely  if  ever  be  required  for  electronic  eavesdropping,  which  was  surely not Congress’s intent.
This category includes federal corrections officers.
or  (c)  endeavors  to  disclose,  to  any  other  person  the  contents  of  any  wire,  oral,  or  electronic  communication,  knowing or having reason to know  that  the  information  was  obtained  through the interception of a wire,  oral,  or  electronic  communication  in violation of this subsection .
In addition, disclosure  of  the  contents  of  an  intercepted  communication  that  has  already  become  “public information” or “common knowledge” is not prohibited.
Mental state Section 2511(1)(c) has two mental state requirements.
The act of disclosing a communication must be done “intentionally.” This  is the same mental state requirement that is discussed above in connection with  section 2511(1)(a).
The prosecution must also prove that the disclosing individual knew or had  reason to know that the “information was obtained through the interception  of a wire, oral, or electronic communication in violation of this subsection.”  18 U.S.C.
1994)  (requiring  proof  “that  the  defendant  knew  or  should  have  known that the interception was illegal”).
Section  2511(1)(c)  requires  that  the  disclosed information be obtained through an interception that was “in violation   74    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  of this subsection.” (emphasis added).
810, 816 (N.D.  Okla.  1996)  (“Since  it  is  not  a  violation  under  § 2511  to  intercept  readily  accessible governmental radio communications, § 2511(1)(c) and (d) do not  prohibit divulgence or use of such communications.”).
First Amendment Concerns The First Amendment prevents application of section 2511(1)(c) to the  disclosure  of  information  of  public  concern  by  a  third  party  not  involved  in  the  interception,  when  the  third  party  had  no  other  duty  to  keep  the  information confidential.
In Bartnicki,  several news organizations received a tape recording of a telephone conversation  that  they  should  have  known  was  illegally  intercepted.
The Supreme  Court held that the disclosures by the news organizations were not unlawful.
For  instance,  a  defendant  will  not  be  exempt  from prosecution merely because he discloses information of interest to the  public.
In Bartnicki, the Supreme Court explicitly did not address cases where (1)  the disclosing party participated in any illegality in obtaining the information,  or (2) the disclosure is of “trade secrets or domestic gossip or other information  of purely private concern.” Id.
Thus,  not  everyone  “who  has  lawfully  obtained  truthful  information  of  public importance has a First Amendment right to disclose that information.”  Boehner v. McDermott, 484 F.3d 573, 577 (D.C. Cir.
(d) intentionally uses, or endeavors to  use,  the  contents  of  any  wire,  oral, or electronic communication, knowing or having reason to  know that the information was obtained through the interception  of a wire, oral, or electronic communication in violation of this  subsection .
However, “use” does require some “active employment of the  contents of the illegally intercepted communication for some purpose.” Peavy   2.
Accordingly, “use” does not include mere  listening to intercepted conversations.
2007) (recognizing distinction between prohibiting speech and prohibiting  uses of information).
In the network context, other uses might include the use of  intercepted passwords to gain access to other computers or use of intercepted  confidential business information for commercial advantage.
The  exceptions  that  are  particularly  relevant  in  the  context  of  network   crimes are discussed below.
Those circumstances generally require a showing that the  consenting party received actual notice of the monitoring and chose to use  the monitored system anyway.
1990)  (“[I]mplied  consent  is  consent  in  fact  which  is  inferred  from  surrounding  circumstances indicating that the party knowingly agreed to the surveillance.”)  (internal quotation marks omitted); Berry v. Funk, 146 F.3d 1003, 1011 (D.C.  Cir.
1998) (“Without actual notice, consent can only be implied when the  surrounding  circumstances  convincingly  show  that  the  party  knew  about   80    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  and consented to the interception.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).
2003) (“[i]f Munoz was required to place  a mechanical device into her ear in order to record the conversation, there can  be little doubt that she was aware the conversation was being intercepted”).
One way of proving actual notice is a network banner alerting the user  that  communications  on  the  network  are  monitored  and  intercepted;  this  banner may be used to demonstrate that a user furnished consent to intercept  communications on that network.
Generally, network banners do not require  users to consent to the monitoring of their communications by just anyone,  but, rather, only by their employer or by the owner of the computer network.
1974)  (tortious  or  criminal  acts  can  include  “blackmailing  the  other  party,  threatening  him,  or  publicly  embarrassing him”).
Provider Exception The Wiretap Act provides that:  It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for an operator of a  switchboard, or an officer, employee, or agent of a provider of  a wire or electronic communication service, whose facilities are  used in the transmission of a wire or electronic communication,  to intercept, disclose, or use that communication in the normal  course of his employment while engaged in any activity which  is a necessary incident to the rendition of his service or to the  protection  of  the  rights  or  property  of  the  provider  of  that  service, except that a provider of wire communication service  to  the  public  shall  not  utilize  service  observing  or  random  monitoring  except  for  mechanical  or  service  quality  control  checks.
For example, system administrators can track intruders  within their networks in order to prevent further damage.

1975)  (concluding  that  phone  company  investigating  use of illegal devices designed to steal long-distance service acted permissibly  under § 2511(2)(a)(i) when it intercepted the first two minutes of every illegal  conversation but did not intercept legitimately authorized communications).

These cases concerning wire communications suggest that the “necessary  incident  to  the  rendition  of  his  service”  language  would  likewise  permit  a  system administrator to intercept communications in the course of repairing  or maintaining a computer network.
The “Accessible to the Public” Exception, 18 U.S.C.
[the] communication is readily accessible to the general  public.”  Congress  intended  this  language  to  permit  the  interception  of  an  electronic communication that has been posted to a public bulletin board, a  public chat room, or a Usenet newsgroup.
This exception  may apply even if users are required to register and agree to terms of use in  order to access the communication.
2006)  (electronic  bulletin  board  that  required  visitors  to register, obtain a password, and certify that they were not associated with  DirecTV was accessible to the public).

Section 2510(16) defines “readily accessible to the  general public” with respect to radio communications.
Encrypted electronic  communications  sent  over  radio  are  not  “readily  accessible  to  the  general  public.”  18  U.S.C.
Radio  transmissions  transmitted  “by  any  governmental, law enforcement, civil defense, private land mobile, or public  safety communications system, including police and fire, readily accessible to the  general public,” such as police-band radio transmissions, are also unprotected.
810, 816 (N.D.  Okla. 1996) (“If a governmental radio communication is ‘readily accessible to  the general public,’ then where is the harm in intercepting it and divulging the  contents of the communication?”).

Unlawful Access to Stored Communications:   18 U.S.C.
§ 2701  Section 2701 focuses on protecting email and voicemail from unauthorized  access.
A  felony  conviction  requires  proof  of  one  additional element.
Intentional access 2.  without or in excess of authorization 3.  a facility that provided an electronic   communication service  4.  obtained, altered, or prevented       authorized access to a communication  in electronic storage  intentionally   (Felony)  5.  for commercial advantage, malicious     destruction or damage, private        commercial gain, or in furtherance of a   criminal or tortious act  (1)  accesses  without  authorization  a  facility  through  which  an  electronic  communication  service  is  pro- vided; or (2)  authorization  facility;  intentionally  exceeds  an  that   to  access   and  thereby  obtains,  alters,  or  prevents  authorized  access  to  a  wire  or  electronic communication while it is in electronic storage in such system  shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) of this section.
Intentional Access The mens rea element of a section 2701 violation is that the defendant’s  unauthorized  access  (or  access  in  excess  of  authorization)  was  intentional.
Although  no  court  has  analyzed  the  mens  rea  requirement  for  this  section,  courts  have  addressed  the  mens  rea  requirement  for  similar  language  in  18  U.S.C.
In Sablan,  the Ninth Circuit analyzed the wording, structure, and purpose of what was  then section 1030(a)(5)(A) and concluded that the “intentionally” language  modified  only  the  “accesses  without  authorization”  portion  of  that  statute.
The  statute  does  not  define  the  term  “access”;  please  see  page  37  for  a discussion of this term under section 1030.
In a typical criminal case, in  which a defendant will have logged on to a system and obtained, altered, or  deleted email or voicemail, there will be no question that the defendant has  intentionally accessed a facility.
Without or In Excess of Authorization The  second  element  of  section 2701  requires  proof  that  the  defendant  either was not authorized to access the facility or that the defendant exceeded  authorized  access.
This  element  mirrors  the  “without  authorization”  and  “exceeds authorized access” language of 18 U.S.C.
Facility Through Which an Electronic    Communication Service Is Provided The third element of a section 2701 violation is that the defendant accessed  a  facility  through  which  an  electronic  communication  service  (ECS)  was  provided.
A  provider  of  email  accounts  over  the  Internet  is  a  provider  of  ECS,  see  FTC  v.  Netscape  Communications Corp., 196 F.R.D.
2006) (upholding a dismissal for failure to state a claim,  where defendants used computers to access a website generally available to the  public).
However, not every computer or device connected to a communication  system is a facility through which an ECS is provided: a computer or device  belonging to an end-user of an ECS is not such a facility.
Courts have also rejected the notion that maintaining a website or merely  utilizing Internet access constitutes providing an ECS.
2004)  (airline  selling  travel services over the Internet is not a provider of ECS); Crowley v. Cybersource  Corp., 166 F. Supp.
Obtained, Altered, or Prevented Authorized Access    The  fourth  element  of  a  section 2701  violation  is  that  the  defendant  obtained,  altered,  or  prevented  authorized  access  to  a  wire  or  electronic  communication  while  it  was  in  “electronic  storage.”  This  element  has  three  components.
The first component, that the defendant “obtained, altered, or  prevented authorized access to,” means that a defendant must acquire a stored  communication, modify a stored communication, or prevent proper access to  a stored communication.
The Ninth Circuit, when distinguishing access under section 2701 from  an  interception  under  the  Wiretap  Act,  misinterpreted  this  component.
1998),  the  Ninth  Circuit  stated that “[t]he word ‘intercept’ entails actually acquiring the contents of a  communication, whereas the word ‘access’ merely involves being in position to  acquire the contents of a communication.” Smith, 155 F.3d at 1058 (emphasis   3.
Other Network Crime Statutes   91  in original).
§ 2510(12) and includes most electric or electronic signals that are not wire  communications.
For example, voicemail is a wire communication, and email  and other typical Internet communications that do not contain the human  voice are electronic communications.
The final component of this element is that the communication was in  “electronic  storage.”  The  term  “electronic  storage”  has  a  narrow,  statutorily  defined meaning; it does not simply mean storage of information by electronic  means.
If the communication has  been received by a recipient’s service provider but has not yet been accessed  by the recipient, it is in “electronic storage.” For example, a copy of an email  or voicemail is in “electronic storage” only if it is at an intermediate point in  its transmission and has not yet been retrieved by its intended recipient (e.g.,  undelivered email).
2004),  rejected  this  long-standing  narrow  interpretation  of  “electronic  storage.”  In  Theofel, the Ninth Circuit held that email messages were in electronic storage  regardless of whether they had been previously accessed.
Although the Ninth  Circuit did not dispute that previously accessed email was not in temporary,  intermediate storage  within the  meaning of section 2510(17)(A), it insisted  that previously accessed email fell within the scope of the “backup” portion of  the definition of “electronic storage.” Id.
Pa. 2007) (holding  that access to opened email in account held by non-public service provider did  not violate the Stored Communications Act), with Bailey v. Bailey, 2008 WL  324156, at *6 (E.D.
However, CCIPS continues  to question whether Theofel was correctly decided, since little reason exists for  treating old email differently than other material a user may choose to store  on a network.
Other Network Crime Statutes   93  relies on the interpretation used in Theofel, we urge you to contact CCIPS for  consultation.
Purpose Felony charges require proof of one additional element: that the defendant  acted “for purposes of commercial advantage, malicious destruction or damage,  or private commercial gain, or in furtherance of any criminal or tortious act.” 18  U.S.C.
Naturally,  the  wording “in furtherance of any criminal or tortious act” means an act other  than the unlawful access to stored communications itself.
Thus, unlike in the Wiretap  Act context, service providers cannot violate section 2701, regardless of their  motives in accessing stored communications.

§ 1030(c)(2)(B), to enhance the pen- alty for a violation of § 1030(a)(2), which criminalizes accessing a computer without authori- zation or in excess of authorization.
Penalties The penalties for unlawful access to stored communications fall into three  categories.
First, prior to the  Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.
Second, one element of  prosecutions can be difficult to prove: that the defendant obtained, altered, or  prevented authorized access to communications in “electronic storage,” a term  that is narrowly defined in 18 U.S.C.
§ 2510(17) and that has traditionally  been  interpreted  to  include  only  communications  that  have  not  yet  been  accessed by their intended recipient.

For a more detailed  treatment of identity theft, see U.S. Department of Justice, Identity Theft and  Social Security Fraud (Office of Legal Education 2004).
Several federal laws apply to identity theft, including 18 U.S.C.
That  section  criminalizes  eight  types  of  conduct  involving  fraudulent  identification  documents  or  the  unlawful  use  of  identification  information.
Section  1028(a)(7),  enacted  as  part  of  the  Identity  Theft  and  Assumption  Deterrence Act of 1998 and amended in 2004 by the Identity Theft Penalty  Enhancement Act, will apply to some network crime cases.
2007) (affirming conviction under  section 1028(a)(7) for posting stolen social security numbers on website).
2007) (“[T]he natural reading of the  word ‘person’ in the phrase ‘means of identification of another person’ includes  persons deceased.”); United States v. Maciel-Alcala, 2008 WL 4369299, at *2- 3 (C.D.
Further-  96    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  The  term  “means  of  identification”  refers  to  “any  name  or  number  that  may  be  used,  alone  or  in  conjunction  with  any  other  information,  to  identify a specific individual.” 18 U.S.C.
The statute provides  several specific examples, such as name; social security number, date of birth,  government issued driver’s license, and other numbers; unique biometric data,  such as fingerprints, voice print, retina or iris image, or other unique physical  representation;  unique  electronic  identification  number,  address,  or  routing  code; and telecommunication identifying information or access device.
There is little controversy about classifying a unique identifier, such as a  social security number, as a “means of identification.” However, courts disagree  about whether non-unique identifiers—including those, such as names and  birthdates, that are included in the statutory definition—qualify as a “means of  identification” when standing alone.
Under one reading, the answer is yes—a  piece of information is a “means of identification,” even if it does not pinpoint  a specific person on its own, as long as the information could potentially be  coupled with other information to do so.
§ 1028(d)(7) (means of  identification includes names or numbers that “may be used .
in conjunction  with other information [] to identify a specific individual”) (emphasis added).
On the other hand, the Fourth Circuit has held that non-unique identifiers  are not “means of identification” unless they are actually used in conjunction  with additional information that permits the identification of a specific person.
Other Network Crime Statutes   97  Jackson.
However, the additional information  on the license, such as address and date of birth, did not match those of any  actual Marcus Jackson.
Because the information used by the defendant,  taken as a whole, did not identify a specific person, the court held that the  defendant did not use a “means of identification” and reversed his conviction.
at 234 (non-unique identifiers listed in the statutory  definition, such as names, do not “qualify as a means of identification” unless  “coupled with other information to identify a specific individual”).3   In any event, prosecutors pursuing charges under section 1028(a)(7) must  be careful to ensure that the evidence will permit them to meet their burden  with  regard  to  intent.
In  Flores-Figueroa  v.  United  States,  129  S.  Ct.  1886,  1889 (2009), the Supreme Court held that section 1028A, which criminalizes  “knowingly transfer[ing], possess[ing], or us[ing], without lawful authority, a  means of identification of another person,” requires the government to show  that “the defendant knew that the means of identification at issue belonged to  another person.” Id.
§ 1028A(a)(1), prosecutors should be prepared  to make the evidentiary showing required by that case in section 1028(a)(7)  prosecutions.
Section 1028(a)(7) also requires a predicate offense, much like section 1028A  (discussed below).
98    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  In most cases, the government will be required to prove that the “production,  transfer, possession, or use prohibited by [section 1028] is in or affects interstate  commerce”  in  order  to  invoke  federal  jurisdiction.
This standard is satisfied  if  the  government  proves  that  the  defendant  had  the  intent  to  accomplish  acts  that,  if  successful,  would  have  affected  interstate  or  foreign  commerce;  however, the government need not prove that the defendant had knowledge of  the potential effects on interstate commerce when he committed the offense.
1998) (rejecting defendant’s argument that section  1028 conviction required showing that stolen identification document traveled  in  interstate  commerce;  jurisdictional  requirement  satisfied  by  showing  that  “possession  of  the  [document]  was  integral  to  his  scheme  to  defraud  businesses .

Application to Network Crimes The Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act, which took effect July 15,  2004, established a new offense of aggravated identity theft.
Section 1028A  applies  when  a  defendant  “knowingly  transfers,  possesses,  or  uses,  without  lawful authority, a means of identification of another person” during and in  relation to any felony violation of certain enumerated federal offenses, including  18 U.S.C.
For example, “carders,” who sell or trade stolen  credit or debit card account information on online forums, or “phishers,” who  obtain the same type of information via fraudulent emails, often violate section  1029, a predicate crime for a section 1028A charge.
Similarly, defendants who  engage in hacking activity in violation of section 1030 and obtain identity or  account information often may also violate this section.
2007)  (“[T]he  natural  reading  of  the  word ‘person’ in the phrase ‘means of identification of another person’ includes  persons deceased.”); United States v. Maciel-Alcala, 2008 WL 4369299, at *2- 3 (C.D.
§ 1028(d) (7)  and  encompasses  “any  name  or  number  that  may  be  used,  alone  or  in   100    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  conjunction  with  any  other  information,  to  identify  a  specific  individual.”  As  discussed  above  in  the  context  of  section  1028(a)(7),  it  is  not  entirely  clear whether a non-unique identifier, such as a name, qualifies as a “means  of identification” when standing alone or whether it must be combined with  additional information that permits the identification of a specific individual  (see page 96 above).
2008) (knowledge requirement does not apply to “of another person”), United  States v. Hurtado, 508 F.3d 603 (11th Cir.
Flores- Figueroa, a citizen of Mexico, gave his employer counterfeit social security and  alien registration cards that displayed his real name and numbers belonging  to other people.

D.  Access Device Fraud: 18 U.S.C.
§ 1029  Ten  separate  activities  relating  to  access  devices  are  criminalized  in  18   U.S.C.
The term “access device” is defined to mean  any card, plate, code, account number, electronic serial number,  mobile identification number, personal identification number,  or other telecommunications service, equipment, or instrument  identifier, or other means of account access that can be used,  alone or in conjunction with another access device, to obtain  money, goods, services, or any other thing of value, or that can  be  used  to  initiate  a  transfer  of  funds  (other  than  a  transfer  originated solely by paper instrument).
Prosecutors commonly bring charges under section  1029 in many types of “phishing” cases, where a defendant uses fraudulent  emails to obtain bank account numbers and passwords, and “carding” cases,   102    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  where a defendant purchases, sells, or transfers stolen bank account, credit card,  or debit card information.
The  definition  of  “access  device”  is  “broad”  and  “open-ended”  in  order  to ensure that the statute encompasses new access devices made available by  technological innovation.
The court held that the false  UPCs  were  not  access  devices,  noting  that  “courts  interpret  [s]ection  1029  as requiring access to a system that monitors or tracks an ongoing account  relationship between two parties,” whereas the false UPC codes only served as a  means of accessing Wal-Mart’s internal ledger that tracked payments made and  goods sold for inventory purposes.
The court reasoned, “[d]efining  ‘account’ to include such a general ledger system would turn [section] 1029  into a general theft statute applicable whenever a company can document loss  through fraud.” Id.
at *4 (internal quotation marks omitted).
2006) (concluding non-revenue airline tickets,  which defendant stole and sold to others, did not constitute an “access device”  because they did not access an account; rather, the information on the tickets  only accessed the airline’s internal ledger system).
Because  of  these  successful  challenges,  cases  are  stronger  in  which  the  mechanism at issue permits access to an “identifiable account that exemplifies  an ongoing relationship” between two parties, Lutz, 2008 WL 4449082, at *5.
It is worth noting, however, that the device does not necessarily have to access a  customer account to constitute an “access device.” See, e.g., United States v. Ashe,  47 F.3d 770 (6th Cir.
1995) (altered cell phones were access devices, despite   3.
Other Network Crime Statutes   103  the fact they did not affect customer accounts, because they accessed accounts  that cell phone service providers had with each other).
Section  1029  prohibits  the  production,  use,  possession,  or  trafficking  of  unauthorized  or  counterfeit  access  devices.
Prosecutors  should  note  the  difference between “unauthorized” and “counterfeit” devices because certain  key  sections  of  the  statute  are  based  on  these  two  terms.
“Unauthorized”  access devices include lost, stolen, or revoked devices, whereas “counterfeit”  ones include fictitious, altered, or forged devices.
Section 1029 also requires that the government prove that  the  offense  “affects  interstate  or  foreign  commerce.”  18  U.S.C.
It  is enough, for example, if an out-of-state institution issues the access devices.

Other Network Crime Statutes   105  Title 18, United States Code, Section 1037(a) provides: Whoever, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly— (1)  accesses  a  protected  computer  without  authorization,  and  intentionally  initiates  the  transmission  of  multiple  commercial  electronic mail messages from or through such computer, (2)  uses  a  protected  computer  to  relay  or  retransmit  multiple  commercial electronic mail messages, with the intent to deceive or  mislead recipients, or any Internet access service, as to the origin of  such messages, (3) materially falsifies header information in multiple commercial  electronic mail messages and intentionally initiates the transmission  of such messages, (4) registers, using information that materially falsifies the identity  of the actual registrant, for five or more electronic mail accounts  or  online  user  accounts  or  two  or  more  domain  names,  and  intentionally  initiates  the  transmission  of  multiple  commercial  electronic mail messages from any combination of such accounts or  domain names, or (5) falsely represents oneself to be the registrant or the legitimate  successor in interest to the registrant of 5 or more Internet Protocol  addresses, and intentionally initiates the transmission of multiple  commercial  electronic  mail  messages  from  such  addresses,  or  conspires to do so, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b).
2d  1051,  1064  (D.  Ariz.  2007)  (defendant  “initiated”  electronic  messages,  within  the  meaning  of  CAN-SPAM  Act,  when  he  paid  another  individual  to send said messages; defendant also materially falsified information, within  the meaning of section 1037, when third party altered header at defendant’s  instruction).
The term “commercial electronic mail message”  means  any  electronic  mail  message  the  primary  purpose  of  which  is  the  commercial  advertisement  or  promotion  of  a  commercial  product  or  service  (including  content  on  an  Internet website operated for a commercial purpose).
The  “commercial  electronic  mail  message”  does  not  include  a  transactional or relationship message.
While the most common type of “electronic mail message”  is email, other types of communication, such as messages sent between users  of social networking sites, may also qualify.
Materially Falsified Sections 1037(a)(3) and (a)(4) require proof that certain information was   “materially” falsified:   For purposes of paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (a), header  information or registration information is materially falsified if  it is altered or concealed in a manner that would impair the  ability of a recipient of the message, an Internet access service  processing  the  message  on  behalf  of  a  recipient,  a  person  alleging a violation of this section, or a law enforcement agency  to  identify,  locate,  or  respond  to  a  person  who  initiated  the  electronic mail message or to investigate the alleged violation.
One court has rejected a technical approach to this  portion of the CAN-SPAM Act that would create liability for an inaccuracy  in the header information where the sum total of the information provided in  the message makes clear who sent the message and how they can be located  and  contacted.
2006) (commercial emails that contained nonfunctioning  “from” email address and inaccurate information regarding server from which  email originated were not materially false or misleading; emails contained link  through  which  recipient  could  unsubscribe  from  future  messages,  provided  valid address and phone number for sender, and accurately identified name  and domain name of sender); but see Aitken v. Comm’n Workers of America, 496   3.

A court has also rejected a defense argument that registration and header  information was not materially falsified if the information, while accurate, leads  back to a third party intermediary.
2d  1051 (D. Ariz. 2007), the court concluded that the third party was “a front,  a shill, and [the defendant] intentionally designed the header information to  impair the ability of recipients and others to identify [him].” Id.

§ 1343  One  particularly  powerful  and  commonly  applicable  charge  in  network  crime  cases  is  wire  fraud,  18  U.S.C.

Application to network crimes Courts have recognized a variety of means of communications, including  facsimile,  telex,  modem,  and  Internet  transmissions,  as  constituting  “wire,  radio,  or  television  communication[s].”  See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.  Selby,  557  F.3d 968, 978-79 (9th Cir.

2001) (affirming sentence of defendant who used the Internet to commit  wire fraud).
Sections 1343 and 1030(a)(4) overlap to a substantial degree; both require  fraudulent intent.
110    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  Title 18, United States Code, Section 1362 provides:  Whoever  willfully  or  maliciously  injures  or  destroys  any  of  the  works, property, or material of any radio, telegraph, telephone or  cable, line, station, or system, or other means of communication,  operated or controlled by the United States, or used or intended to  be used for military or civil defense functions of the United States,  whether constructed or in process of construction, or willfully or  maliciously interferes in any way with the working or use of any  such line, or system, or willfully or maliciously obstructs, hinders,  or  delays  the  transmission  of  any  communication  over  any  such  line, or system, or attempts or conspires to do such an act, shall be  fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or  both.
Application to Network Crimes  Section 1362 applies to “any of the works, property, or material of any  radio, telegraph, telephone or cable, line, station, or system, or other means  of communication, operated or controlled by the United States, or used or  intended to be used for military or civil defense functions of the United States.”  18 U.S.C.

Other Network Crime Statutes   111  112    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  Chapter 4 Special Considerations  Jurisdiction  A.
Interstate Commerce or Communication Requirement Several  of  the  statutes  discussed  in  this  manual  require  an  interstate  or  foreign jurisdictional hook.
§ 1029(a) (prohibiting access  device fraud “if the offense affects interstate or foreign commerce”); 18 U.S.C.
In the context of computer crime, the inexorable connection between the  Internet and interstate commerce may sometimes be sufficient to satisfy the  jurisdictional element of the statute at issue.
§ 1030 prohibit unlawful access of a “protected computer,” which  includes a computer used in or affecting “interstate or foreign commerce or  communication.”  18  U.S.C.
In  most  cases,  demonstrating  that a computer was connected to the Internet will satisfy this requirement.
Iowa 2009) (concluding computers qualified  as protected computers because they were connected to Internet); Continental  Group, Inc. v. KW Property Management, LLC, 622 F. Supp.
Fla. 2009) (“A connection to the internet is ‘affecting interstate commerce  or communication.’”).
113  Similarly, several courts have indicated a willingness to assume that a crime  took place “in or affecting interstate commerce” as long as there is evidence  that  the  defendant  used  the  Internet  in  connection  with  the  offense.
Pa. 2009), the  Court rejected the argument that a wire fraud conviction required evidence  that certain emails actually crossed state lines.
The court concluded, “[I]t is  legally sufficient for purposes of the ‘interstate commerce’ requirement that  the  emails  at  issue  were  sent  and  received  through  the  Internet.”  Id.
2007) (noting,  in  context  of  prosecution  under  section  1028,  that  “it  seems  clear  that  use  of  the  internet  is  intimately  related  to  interstate  commerce”);  United  States  v. Horne, 474 F.3d 1004, 1006 (7th Cir.
2007) (because defendant utilized  Internet to locate and arrange meetings with victims, which he would then rob,  government needed to show no further nexus to interstate commerce to sustain  Hobbs Act conviction); United States v. MacEwan, 445 F.3d 237, 244 (3d Cir.
2006) (“Regardless of the route taken, however, we conclude that because of  the very interstate nature of the Internet .
Here, once the images of child pornography left the website server  and entered the complex global data transmission system that is the Internet,  the  images  were  being  transmitted  in  interstate  commerce.”);  United  States  v.  Carroll,  105  F.3d  740,  742  (1st  Cir.
1997)  (holding,  in  context  of  child  pornography  prosecution,  that  “[t]ransmission  of  photographs  by  means  of  the Internet is tantamount to moving photographs across state lines and thus  constitutes transportation in interstate commerce”); United States v. Runyan,  290 F.3d 223, 239 (5th Cir.
In child pornography case, the Tenth Circuit “decline[d] to assume that  Internet use automatically equates with a movement across state lines”; instead,  “the government must introduce evidence to satisfy its burden of proof” with  regard to interstate movement.

v. Arabian  American Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248 (1991) (internal citations omitted).
The USA PATRIOT Act added the following language to section 1029:  (h)  Any  person  who,  outside  the  jurisdiction  of  the  United  States,  engages  in  any  act  that,  if  committed  within  the  jurisdiction of the United States, would constitute an offense  under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, shall be subject to  the fines, penalties, imprisonment, and forfeiture provided in  this title if—  (1) the offense involves an access device issued, owned,  managed,  or  controlled  by  a  financial  institution,  account  issuer,  credit  card  system  member,  or  other  entity within the jurisdiction of the United States; and (2) the person transports, delivers, conveys, transfers to  or through, or otherwise stores, secrets, or holds within  the jurisdiction of the United States, any article used to   4.
The  Act  also  amended  section  1030(e)(2)(B)  to  specifically  include  a  computer that “is used in interstate or foreign commerce, including a computer  located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate  or  foreign  commerce  or  communication  of  the  United  States.”  18  U.S.C.
Other sources of extraterritorial jurisdiction may include 18 U.S.C.
See 2 Charles Alan Wright, Federal Practice & Procedure § 301 (3d ed.
This principle is implemented by Federal Rule of  Criminal Procedure 18, which states in full: “Unless a statute or these rules  permit otherwise, the government must prosecute an offense in a district where   116    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  the offense was committed.
However, the  Constitution and Rule 18 still leave questions unanswered in many network  crime cases, such as how to define where an offense has been “committed” or  how to deal with crimes committed in multiple states or countries.
Note, however, that both rules require  the explicit consent and cooperation of the defendant.
Locations of Network Crimes Applying  the  principles  of  venue  to  network  crimes  is  not  always  a  straightforward  endeavor.
Yet, “in today’s wired  world of telecommunication and technology, it is often difficult to determine  exactly where a crime was committed, since different elements may be widely  scattered in both time and space, and those elements may not coincide with  the accused’s actual presence.” United States v. Saavedra, 223 F.3d 85, 86 (2d  Cir.
2005) (finding  venue in district where agent connected to Internet, entered chat room, and  saw defendant’s posting in child porn case); United States v. Allamon, 2005  WL 2542905 (S.D.N.Y.
For instance, section 1030(a) (2)(C)  prohibits  intentionally  accessing  a  computer  without  or  in  excess  of  authorization, and thereby obtaining information from any protected computer.
The two essential conduct elements in section 1030(a)(2)(C) are “accessing”  a computer and “obtaining” information.
Thus, it would seem logical that a  crime under section 1030(a)(2)(C) is committed where the offender initiates  access and where the information is obtained.
The exact location of each event—the “accessing” and the “obtaining”—  may not always be easily determined.
Example: An intruder located in California uses communications  that  pass  through  a  router  in  Arizona  to  break  into  a  network  in  Illinois  and  then  uses  those  network  connections  to  obtain  information from a server in Kentucky.
The  intruder  initiated  access  in  California,  and  the  router  in  Arizona  enabled that access.
Arguably, however, the intruder did not achieve access until  reaching the network in Illinois.
Of course, one could also argue that access  did  not  occur  until  the  intruder  reached  the  server  in  Kentucky  where  the  information was located.
Likewise, one could argue that the intruder obtained  the information in Kentucky, or that he did not obtain the information until it  reached him in the district where he was located, in this case, California.
Under any of the options discussed above, the appropriate venue would seem  to include both of the endpoints—that is, the district in which the offender  is  located  (California)  and  the  district  in  which  the  information  is  located  (Kentucky).
Under this   118    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  section, the “accessing” and “obtaining” arguably continued in Arizona and  Illinois.
Certainly, venue seems proper in Illinois where the intruder broke into  the network.
By contrast, in cases where the path of transmission  is unpredictable, a court may find it difficult to conclude that a crime was  committed in a district merely because packets of information happened to  travel through that district.
§ 3237(a), which also includes the place where  the conduct continued, thus leaving open the door to “pass through” venue.
§ 1030(a)(5) may be brought where the effects are felt because those charges  are defined in terms of “loss,” even if the bulk of network crimes may not be  prosecuted in a district simply because the effects of the crime are felt there.
§ 1030(g) (requiring  civil actions to be brought “within 2 years of the date of the act complained  of or the date of the discovery of the damage”); see also 18 U.S.C.
These crimes are included in the list of offenses in 18 U.S.C.
1986) (determinative date is date of  filing of formal indictment or information; fact that government could have  brought charges against defendant prior to his twenty-first birthday held to  be  “irrelevant”);  see  also  United  States  v.  Hoo,  825  F.2d  667  (2d  Cir.
With regard to the former, although  many states have enacted laws analogous to statutes such as the federal network  crime statute (18 U.S.C.
§ 2511), and the access device fraud statute (18 U.S.C.
Penal Law § 156.10 (computer trespass); § 156.27  (computer tampering in the first degree); § 250.05 (intercepting or accessing  electronic communications), but will be unwilling to assume jurisdiction over  the juvenile, perhaps because of a shortage of resources or a dearth of technical  or  prosecutorial  expertise.
The FJDA, however, does not appear to require the government  to certify that each state that could potentially assert jurisdiction is unwilling  to assume that jurisdiction.
The FJDA merely requires that the “juvenile court  or other appropriate court of a State does not have jurisdiction or refuses to  assume jurisdiction over [the] juvenile.” 18 U.S.C.
Typically,  the  pertinent  state  will  be  the  state  contemplating  proceedings  against the minor and which, in practice, will often be the state in which the  federal prosecutor investigating the case sits.
The enumerated offenses  are controlled substance offenses under 21 U.S.C.
“Crimes of violence” also include any offense “that is a felony   124    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the  person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the  offense.” 18 U.S.C.
However, several statutes may implicate this basis for jurisdiction  in  the  context  of  computer-related  crime,  including  18  U.S.C.
Yet, even when the government is not the victim, federal  interests often exist because network crimes affect critical infrastructures (e.g.,  telecommunications systems) or industries or technologies significant to the  nation’s economy (e.g., aerospace, computer software), or they are committed  by  criminals  operating  in  multiple  states  and/or  foreign  countries.
Delinquency Proceedings Assuming  that  federal  juvenile  jurisdiction  exists,  prosecutors  bringing  such actions will typically commence the action with the filing, under seal,  of a juvenile information and the jurisdictional certification.
(requiring  certification of the Attorney General).
These include: (1) the right to notice of the  charges; (2) the right to counsel; (3) the right to confront and cross-examine  witnesses; and (4) the privilege against self-incrimination.
P. 1(a)(5) (D); see also 3B Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 873  (3d ed.
Moreover, when a juvenile is taken into custody for an alleged  act of delinquency, the juvenile must be informed of his or her legal rights “in  language comprehensible to [the] juvenile,” 18 U.S.C.
When brought before a  magistrate, the juvenile must be released to his or her parents or guardian upon  their promise to bring the juvenile to court for future appearances, unless the  magistrate determines that the detention of the juvenile is required to secure  his  or  her  appearance  before  the  court  or  to  ensure  the  juvenile’s  safety  or  the safety of others.
The  FDJA  identifies  six  factors  that  the  court  should consider to determine whether to grant a transfer: (1) the age and social  background of the juvenile; (2) the nature of the alleged offense, including the  juvenile’s leadership role in a criminal organization; (3) the nature and extent  of the juvenile’s prior delinquency record; (4) the juvenile’s present intellectual  development  and  psychological  maturity;  (5)  the  juvenile’s  response  to  past  treatment  efforts  and  the  nature  of  those  efforts;  and  (6)  the  availability  of  programs to treat the juvenile’s behavioral problems.
It is limited to certain enumerated offenses (e.g., arson), which typically are  not  applicable  in  network  crime  prosecutions,  and  violent  felonies  directed  against other persons.
As a practical matter, therefore,  in the area of network crimes, the majority of proceedings begun as juvenile  proceedings are unlikely to be transferred to adult prosecutions.
Accordingly, you should consult the Sentencing Guidelines, although they are  not controlling.
For  example,  common investigative techniques such as undercover operations and the use  of cooperators and informants can raise difficult issues rarely present in the  investigation of adults.
2000) (ruling that juvenile’s confession should be suppressed where  arresting officer’s failure to inform parents may have been a factor in confession,  notwithstanding juvenile’s request to arresting officers that her parents not be  contacted and informed of the arrest).
Special considerations also arise in transnational contexts, such as a case in  which a juvenile in a foreign country uses the Internet to damage a government  computer  or  an  e-commerce  web  server.
Prosecutors  who  encounter  situations  involving  network  crimes  by  juveniles  operating  from  abroad should, in addition to consulting with the Department’s Gang Unit,  consult with the Department’s Office of International Affairs at (202) 514- 0000.
Special Considerations   129     130    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  Chapter 5 Sentencing  This  section  addresses   the  United  States  Sentencing  Guidelines   (“Guidelines”)  and  the  specific  offense  characteristics  and  adjustments  commonly applicable to network crimes.
The Guidelines treat most network crimes as basic economic offenses for  which  U.S.S.G.
Sentencing Guidelines for Network Crimes Section of 18 U.S.C.
§ 1028(a)(7) § 1029 § 1030(a)(2), (4), (5), (6) § 1037 § 1343 § 1362 § 2701 § 1030(a)(1) § 1030(a)(3) § 1030(a)(7) § 2511  Base Offense Level 6; 7 if the statutory maximum  term for defendant’s convic- tion is 20 years or more  Guidelines § 2B1.1  § 2M3.2 § 2B2.3 § 2B3.2 §§ 2B5.3, 2H3.1  30; 35 for TS information 4 18 8, 9  As noted in Table 4, most network crimes will be sentenced under U.S.S.G.
Courts are not required to determine precisely the amount  of  loss  attributable  to  a  defendant.
That  reasonable  estimate  should  take  into  account  available  information,  including, but not limited to, the following: “[t]he fair market value of the  property taken [or] copied .
Additionally, effective November 1, 2009,  the Guidelines permit sentencing courts to estimate losses in cases involving  proprietary information such as trade secrets by taking into account “the cost  of developing that information or the reduction in value of that information”  resulting from the offense.
This language  codifies the practice that some courts had already adopted.
2005) (upholding calculation of loss by district  court  that  took  into  account  the  costs  of  developing  specialty  commercial  software that had been illegally copied).
132    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  In  estimating  the  loss  resulting  from  a  defendant’s  unlawful  intrusions,  courts should include the reasonable cost of any harm caused by his criminal  conduct.
Such amounts should include the reasonable value of the property  taken by defendant (such as the data copied) even if the defendant did not  deprive  the  owner  of  such  data.
Generally,  “actual  loss”  is  limited  to  “reasonably  foreseeable  pecuniary  harm that resulted from the offense.” In addition, the definition of “intended  loss” makes it clear that intended pecuniary harm should be counted even if it  “would have been impossible or unlikely to occur.”  Beyond  the  general  rules  for  calculating  loss  under  the  Guidelines,  an  additional comment expands the definition of “actual loss” to include certain  additional harms, whether or not reasonably foreseeable, in cases brought under  18 U.S.C.
The commentary to  the 2008 Guidelines states that for such offenses:  actual  loss  includes  the  following  pecuniary  harm,  regardless  of whether such pecuniary harm was reasonably foreseeable: any  reasonable cost to the victim including the cost of responding  to an offense, conducting a damage assessment, and restoring  the data, program, system, or information to its condition prior  to  the  offense,  and  any  revenue  lost,  cost  incurred,  or  other  damages incurred because of interruption of service.
This additional language expands the usual  definition of “actual loss” for section 1030 offenses by including the value of  certain pecuniary harms even if not reasonably foreseeable, but does not alter  the definition of “intended loss.” Id.
Given that instructions  for exploiting known computer network vulnerabilities are easily shared via the  Internet, the cost incurred by a victim to prevent attacks of those who might  follow the defendant may be allowable as well.
Section 1030(g) requires that civil plaintiffs prove one of the factors  in  1030(c)(4)(A)(i)—typically  loss  of  more  than  $5,000—before  they  can  prevail.
There are parallels between the language in the Guidelines commentary for  loss in section 1030 cases and the definition of loss that is required to prove  a felony violation under 18 U.S.C.
Section  1030(e)(11)  begins  the  definition  of  “loss”  by  stating  that  loss  “means  any  reasonable  cost  to  any  victim.”  It  then  provides  a  nonexclusive  list  of  costs  that  may  be  included  within the definition of “loss” such as:  the  cost  of  responding  to  an  offense,  conducting  a  damage  assessment,  and  restoring  the  data,  program,  system,  or  information  to  its  condition  prior  to  the  offense,  and  any  revenue  lost,  cost  incurred,  or  other  consequential  damages  incurred because of interruption of service .
2005)  (“revenue  lost  because a defendant used unlawfully gained information to unfairly compete  was not a type of ‘loss’ contemplated under the CFAA”) (citing Nexans Wires  S.A. v. Sark-USA, Inc., 319 F. Supp.
For example, the fair market value of the data copied  unlawfully by a defendant is clearly a proper category of loss to be attributed  to him at sentencing, regardless of whether or not that value could have been  used to satisfy the loss requirement for a section 1030(a)(5) felony.
Where a network offense includes use of a victim’s services without or in  excess of authorization, loss may include the cost to the victim of providing  such services.
Loss does not include, however, expenses  incurred  cooperating  with  law  enforcement’s  investigation  of  the  offense.
Finally,  section  2B1.1  offers  special  instructions  for  determining  loss  in  cases  involving  “unauthorized  access  devices.”  Section  2B1.1  adopts  the  definitions used in 18 U.S.C.
§ 1029 for the terms “counterfeit access device”  and  “unauthorized  access  device.”  See  U.S.S.G.
The  statute’s  broad  definition  includes  any  code,  account  number,   5.
Sentencing   135  password, personal identification number, or other means of account access  that has been stolen, forged, or obtained with intent to defraud.
1996)  (treating computer passwords as access devices).
Where a defendant obtains  access devices without authorization, such as by stealing a password file or by  Internet credit card phishing, “loss includes any unauthorized charges made  with the counterfeit access device or unauthorized access device and shall not  be less than $500 per access device.” U.S.S.G.
In a credit card phishing case in which the defendant charged $45,000  worth of purchases to fraudulently-obtained credit card numbers, possessed an  additional 250 credit card numbers that he had not used, and also possessed  150 email account passwords, the loss would be equal to the sum of the charges  ($45,000), $500 for each unused credit card number (250 x $500 = $125,000),  and $500 for each password (150 x $500 = $75,000), resulting in a total loss  of $245,000 and an offense level increase of 12 ($500 per access device is the  minimum  loss;  if  the  actual  charges  exceed  $500,  the  higher  figure  should  be used instead).
Under certain circumstances, it may even be appropriate to  determine intended loss by aggregating the credit limits of the access devices:  “[W]here  a  sentencing  court  has  facts  upon  which  to  base  findings  that  a defendant was capable of and intended to use the [credit] cards to secure  amounts at or near their credit limits, aggregating the credit limits of the cards  to calculate loss is appropriate.” See United States v. Say, 923 F. Supp.
This specific offense characteristic may be  particularly important in network crimes such as the propagation of worms or  viruses, crimes that, by their very nature, involve a large number of victims.
Additionally,  the  Guidelines  that  became  effective  November  1,  2009,  provide a broader definition of victim in cases involving “means of identification.”  In such cases, victims include those whose “means of identification were used  unlawfully or without authority” in addition to those suffering actual loss.
Although no reported case offers insight into how courts will apply  this specific offense characteristic to network crimes that cross international  boundaries, there is a strong argument to be made that, even if an offender is  physically located within the United States, he is subject to a two-level increase  provided for in this specific offense characteristic if he avails himself of a foreign  email account to receive, possess, and distribute messages in furtherance of a  fraudulent scheme.
In Singh, the defendant engaged in an elaborate  scheme to obtain international long-distance telephone service free of charge for  sale to third parties.
After initiating a long-distance account with an American  carrier using false information, the defendant would call his Kuwaiti “clients,”  who would then provide him a number (usually in a third country) to which they  wished to be connected.
The telephone companies  were unable to charge the defendant for these international calls (or anything  else, for that matter) due to the fraudulent account information.
A “sophisticated means” enhancement is  appropriate if the offense includes “especially complex or especially intricate  offense  conduct  pertaining  to  the  execution  or  concealment  of  an  offense.”  U.S.S.G.
Prosecutors should consider seeking the “sophisticated means” enhancement  for computer network crimes in which the defendant uses software or technology  to conceal his identity or geographic location.
Trafficking in Access Devices Section 2B1.1 advises sentencing courts to increase the offense level by two  levels (or to increase the offense level to 12, if the two-level increase results in  an offense level lower than 12) if “the offense involved .
trafficking of any  unauthorized access device or counterfeit access device.” U.S.S.G.
The definition of “access device” includes computer passwords and  credit cards.

1987) (upholding district court finding that restaurant receipts containing  credit  card  numbers  are  access  devices).
This  specific  offense  characteristic  may therefore be applicable to computer intrusion cases in which the intruder  obtained  the  victim’s  password  and  to  online  fraud  cases  in  which  the  perpetrators obtain the victims’ password, credit card number, or bank account  information.
Risk of Death or Injury As basic services such as medical treatment, emergency response, public  transportation,  water  treatment,  and  military  protection  rely  increasingly  on computer networks for their maintenance and operation, the risk that a  computer crime might cause death or serious bodily injury increases.
2002)),  for  a  defense  contractor  who  provided  helicopter  armor  that  had  not  undergone  ballistics  tests  when  the  contract  required pretested armor (United States v. Cannon, 41 F.3d 1462, 1467 (11th  Cir.
1995)), and for an airport security manager who consciously disregarded  screening and testing requirements for airport security personnel (United States  v. Saffer, 118 F. Supp.
§ 1030 if his offense involved “an intent to obtain personal information,  or  .
2B1.1(b)(15).2 Application Note 13 defines personal information as:  sensitive  or  private  information  involving  an  identifiable  person (including such information in the possession of a third  party), including (i) medical records; (ii) wills; (iii) diaries; (iv)  private correspondence, including email; (v) financial records;  (vi) photographs of a sensitive or private nature; or (vii) similar  information.
Although  the  information  obtained  in  many  cases  will  fall  squarely  within the examples listed in this definition, other cases may require courts  to extrapolate and determine whether specific information is of a kind that a  reasonable computer user would consider sensitive or private.
First, the provision  does  not  require  a  defendant  to  actually  obtain  personal  information—he  must merely intend to obtain it.
So, for instance, a defendant who accessed  without authorization an email service provider’s mail server but was unable  to  gain  access  to  subscribers’  emails  would  receive  this  enhancement  where  the evidence also included an email or a chat session in which the defendant  indicated that his intent was to obtain subscribers’ emails and mine them for  sensitive, valuable information.
Second, the provision uses the term “obtain,”  a term that has been used broadly in the online context to include accessing or  merely observing information.
2479, 2484 (“‘obtaining information’ [for the purposes  of  18  U.S.C.
§ 1030(a)(2)]  includes  mere  observation  of  the  data.
In the 2009 Guidelines, the enhancement for offenses involving an intent to obtain personal  information has been segregated into a new § 2B1.1(b)(15), and combined with an enhance- ment for disclosures of personal information.
Additionally,  section  2B1.1(b)(15)  includes  a  two-level  enhancement  for the public dissemination of personal information.
However, because the  provision only permits application of either—but not both—enhancements,  it is likely to have limited application: the offender who unlawfully obtains  personal information is typically the same person who disseminates it.
Intentional Damage Section  2B1.1(b)(16)(A)(ii)  requires  a  sentencing  court  to  increase  a  defendant’s  offense  level  by  four  levels  if  the  defendant  intentionally  damages  a  protected  computer  in  violation  of  18  U.S.C.
Critical Infrastructures Section 2B1.1(b)(16) contains a three-tiered approach to computer crimes  affecting or relating to a “critical infrastructure.” An Application Note defines  “critical infrastructure” as:  systems and assets vital to national defense, national security,  economic security, public health or safety, or any combination  of those matters.
Examples  of  critical  infrastructures  include  gas  and  oil  production,  storage,  and  delivery  systems,  water  supply systems, telecommunications networks, electrical power  delivery  systems,  financing  and  banking  systems,  emergency  services (including medical, police, fire, and rescue services),  transportation systems and services (including highways, mass  transit, airlines and airports), and government operations that  provide essential services to the public.
This lowest tier enhancement applies even if the computer in question is not  damaged or disrupted; mere access to such a computer is sufficient to trigger  the two-level increase.
The  third  tier  indicates  that  an  upward  departure  (beyond  offense  level  24) is appropriate if a violation of section 1030 is “so substantial as to have a  debilitating impact on national security, national economic security, national  public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.” U.S.S.G.
The Sentencing Commission provides little  guidance as to what qualifies as a “substantial disruption” or as a “debilitating  impact.” In defining “debilitating impact,” the Commission added the word  “national” as a modifier of “security,” “economic security,” and “public health  or safety,” indicating that with regard to these factors, a local (as opposed to  national) disruption may not qualify as “debilitating.”   C.  CAN-SPAM Act  Section 2B1.1 contains a new two-level increase for defendants who are  convicted  of  violating  the  CAN-SPAM  Act,  18  U.S.C.
The commentary states that the term “improper means”  includes  “unauthorized  harvesting  of  electronic  mail  addresses  of  users  of  a  website, proprietary service, or other online public forum.” U.S.S.G.
142    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  D.  Wiretap Act  Sentences  for  most  violations  of  the  Wiretap  Act  involving  network  crimes are addressed by Guideline § 2H3.1 (Interception of Communications;  Eavesdropping; Disclosure of Tax Return Information).3 The base offense level  is nine.
As a result of being grouped differently than most other network crimes,  violations  of  the  Wiretap  Act  generally  begin  with  a  higher  base  offense  level.
The absence of  these potential enhancements to the offense level for, among other things, the  amount of loss caused by the offense could result in much shorter sentences for  Wiretap Act violations than for unauthorized access to stored communications.

Examples would include pilots, lawyers,  doctors, accountants, chemists, and demolition experts.
2002)) and upon an intruder who demonstrated an  ability to “bypass security protocols to gain access to computer systems” (United  States v. Petersen, 98 F.3d 502, 508 n.5 (9th Cir.
2006) (in section 1030(a)(5) case, upholding sentencing increase based  on use of special skill because commission of the offense involved knowledge  of specific computer program, which required special training, and defendant  had considerable skill in using that program, as demonstrated by fact that he  taught  class  for  that  program).
F.  Conditions of Supervised Release  Increasingly,  prosecutors,  parole  officers,  and  courts  struggle  to  impose  appropriate  conditions  on  the  Internet  use  of  defendants  whose  sentences  include  terms  of  supervised  release.
Where  a  networked  computer  has  been  used  to  perpetrate online fraud, to receive contraband such as child pornography or  stolen credit card numbers, or as the instrument of intrusions into or attacks  on other computers, these considerations may militate in favor of imposing a  restriction on computer use as a condition of supervised release.
Section 3553(a) requires that conditions of supervised release impose upon  a defendant “no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary to  achieve” a valid penological purpose.
When such conditions affect a defendant’s use of the Internet,  a recognized forum for First Amendment activity, this statutory requirement  takes on constitutional implications.
On a  more pragmatic level, courts have noted that in an era when the Internet is a  prevalent means of communication, source of information, and medium for  commercial transactions and the provision of public services, “a strict ban on  all Internet use .
As  a  result,  appellate  courts  have  routinely  struck  down  conditions  of  supervised  release  that  infringe  upon  a  defendant’s  Internet  use  more  than  necessary and have admonished sentencing courts and parole officers to tailor   146    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  the conditions more narrowly to the end to be served.
2003); Scott, 316 F.3d at 737 (suggesting  as an alternative to a total ban on Internet use unannounced inspections of a  defendant’s computer); Holm, 326 F.3d at 879 (suggesting random searches  of  a  defendant’s  computer  and  use  of  filtering  software  as  an  appropriate  condition for a defendant convicted of possessing child pornography); White,  244 F.3d at 1204-07.
At least one court has suggested, however, that a total  ban may be appropriate where a defendant’s crime involves using a computer  to attack or intrude upon others’ networks.
See Scott, 316 F.3d at 736 (dicta)  (“Inveterate intruders who have used access to injure others may be ordered  to give up the digital world.”).
2003) (defendant not allowed home  internet connection and if allowed a computer, would be required to consent  to unannounced inspections of computer as well as installation of monitoring  hardware or software); United States v. Crandon, 173 F.3d 122 (3d Cir.
1999)  (defendant not allowed to use Internet or computer networks unless approved  by probation officer).
These  cases  suggest  that  prosecutors  and  parole  officers  should  work  together to propose to sentencing courts conditions of supervised release that  achieve their objectives while infringing upon defendants’ legitimate Internet  use with care.

§ 1030(e)(9))  “Loss” means any reasonable cost to any victim, including the cost of  responding to an offense, conducting a damage assessment, and restoring the  data, program, system, or information to its condition prior to the offense,  and any revenue lost, cost incurred, or other consequential damages incurred  because of interruption of service.
§ 1030(e)(12))  “Protected computer” means a computer  •	  •	  •	  [exclusively	for	the	use	of	[a financial institution][the United States  Government]]  [used	[by][for] [a financial institution][the United States Government]  and the conduct constituting the offense affects that use [by][for] [the  financial institution][the United States Government]] [which	is	[used in][affecting] [interstate][foreign] [commerce][communic ation], including a computer located outside the United States that is  used in a manner that affects [interstate][foreign] [commerce][communi- cation] of the United States].
§ 1030(a)(1) Computer Fraud—Obtaining National Security Information  The crime of accessing a computer to obtain national security information, as  charged in [Count ___] of the indictment, has four essential elements, which  are:  One, the defendant[s] knowingly accessed a computer [without  authorization][exceeding authorized access];  Two, the defendant[s] obtained information that  •	  •	  [has	been	determined	by	the	United	States	government	by	[Executive  Order][statute] to require protection against unauthorized disclosure  for reasons of [national defense][foreign relations]] [restricted	data	regarding	the	design,	manufacture	or	use	of	atomic	 weapons];  Three, the defendant[s] had reason to believe that the information obtained  could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any  foreign nation; and  Four, the defendant[s] voluntarily and intentionally1  •	  •	  [[caused to be] [communicated][delivered][transmitted] the information  to a person not entitled to receive it] [retained	the	information	and	failed	to	deliver	the	information	to	an	 officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive the infor- mation].
The government is not required to prove that the information obtained by  the defendant[s] was in fact used to the injury of the United States or to the  advantage of any foreign nation.
§ 1030(a)(2) Computer Fraud—Obtaining Confidential Information  The crime of computer fraud to obtain confidential information, as charged  in [Count ___] of the indictment, has [two][three] essential elements, which  are:  One, the defendant[s] intentionally accessed a computer [without  authorization][exceeding authorized access];  Two, the defendant[s] obtained information  •	  •	 •	 •	  [contained	in	a	financial	record	of	[a financial institution][an issuer of  a credit card]]  [on	a	consumer	contained	in	a	file	of	a	consumer	reporting	agency]	 [from	any	[department][agency] of the United States]  [from	any	protected	computer];  [Three, the defendant[s]2  •	 •	 •	  [acted	for	purposes	of	commercial	advantage	or	private	financial	gain] [acted	in	furtherance	of	(describe	criminal	or	tortious	act)] [obtained	information	having	a	value	exceeding	$5,000.00]].
Specific Definitions The phrase “consumer reporting agency” means any person or entity which,  for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages  in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer  credit information or other information for the purpose of furnishing  consumer reports to third parties, and which uses any means or facility of     2 In most felony cases charged under 18 U.S.C.
Finally, if requested by a party and if supported by the  evidence, the court can submit a “greater and lesser included offense” instruction that would  permit separate findings on the aggravating elements as well as a charge without such findings  (i.e., a misdemeanor).
The phrase “financial institution” means:  •	  •	  •	  •	  •	 •	  •	  •	  [an	institution	with	deposits	insured	by	Federal	Deposit	Insurance	 Corporation]  [the	Federal	Reserve	or	a	member	of	the	Federal	Reserve,	including	 any Federal Reserve Bank] [a	credit	union	with	accounts	insured	by	the	National	Credit	Union	 Administration]  [a	member	of	the	Federal	home	loan	bank	system	and	any	home	loan	 bank] [any	institution	of	the	Farm	Credit	System]	 [a	broker-dealer	registered	with	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commis- sion]  [the	Securities	Investor	Protection	Corporation][a	branch	or	agency	 of a foreign bank]  [a	national	banking	association	or	corporation	lawfully	engaged	in	in- ternational or foreign banking].
§ 1030(e)(4))  The phrase “financial record” means information derived from any record  held by [a financial institution][an issuer of a credit card] pertaining to a  customer’s relationship with that entity.
If desired, the Court may instruct the jury that the phrase “obtained  information” “includes merely reading the information.
There is no  requirement that the information be copied or transported.” S. Rep. 104-357,  at 7 (1996), available at 1996 WL 492169.
In earlier amendments addressing  other subsections of section 1030, Congress has also stated that the phrase  “obtained information” includes the mere observation of the data and does  not require the government to prove the data was removed from its original  location or transcribed.
The term  “information” includes information stored in intangible form.
§ 1030(a)(3) Computer Fraud—Accessing a Nonpublic Computer  The crime of accessing a nonpublic computer, as charged in [Count ___] of  the indictment, has three essential elements, which are:  One, the defendant[s] intentionally accessed a nonpublic computer of a[n]  [department][agency] of the United States;  Two, the defendant[s] were without authorization to access any nonpublic  computer of that [department][agency]; and  Three, the defendant[s] accessed a nonpublic computer that was [exclusively	for	the	use	of	the	United	States	Government] [used	[by][for] the United States Government, and the defendant[s]’s  conduct affected that use [by][for] the United States Government].
§ 1030(a)(4) Computer Fraud—Accessing a Computer to Defraud and Obtain Value  The crime of accessing a computer to defraud and obtain value, as charged in  [Count ___] of the indictment, has three essential elements, which are:  One, the defendant[s] knowingly and with intent to defraud accessed a  protected computer [without authorization][exceeding authorized access];  Two, the defendant[s], by accessing the protected computer [without  authorization][exceeding authorized access], furthered the intended fraud; and  Three, •	 •	  [the	defendant[s]	thereby	obtained	anything	of	value] [the	object	of	the	fraud	was	the	use	of	the	computer	and	the	value	of	 such use exceeded $5,000 in any one year.]
§ 1030(a)(5)(A) Computer Fraud—Transmission Of Program To Cause Damage To A  Computer  The crime of transmission of a program to cause damage to a computer, as  charged in [Count ___] of the indictment, has [two][three] essential elements,  which are:  One, the defendant[s] knowingly caused the transmission of [a program] [information][code][a command] to a protected computer; and  Two, the defendant[s], as a result of such conduct, intentionally caused  damage to a protected computer without authorization; and  [Three, as a result of such conduct, the defendant[s] caused:  •	  •	  •	  •	 •	 •	  •	  [loss	to	one	or	more	persons	during	any	one	year	period	of	an	aggre- gate value of $5,000.00 or more] [loss	resulting	from	a	related	course	of	conduct	affecting	one	or	more	 other protected computers of an aggregate value of $5,000.00 or  more]  [the	[potential] modification or impairment of the medical examina- tion, diagnosis, treatment, or care of one or more individuals] [physical	injury	to	any	person] [a	threat	to	public	health	or	safety] [damage	affecting	a	computer	used	[by][for] a government entity (de- scribe entity at issue), in furtherance of the administration of justice,  national defense, or national security] [damage	affecting	ten	or	more	protected	computers	during	any	one	 year period]]3    3 In most felony cases charged under 18 U.S.C.
If requested  by a party and if supported by the evidence, the court can submit a “greater and lesser included  offense” instruction that would permit separate findings on the aggravating elements as well as  a charge without such findings (i.e., a misdemeanor).
If the evidence also supports any one of the lesser aggravat- ing elements from the first alternative element three, the court can submit a “greater and lesser  included offense” instruction that would permit separate findings on both the lesser and the  greater aggravating elements.
§ 1030(a)(5)(B)&(C) Computer Fraud—Causing Damage To a Computer  The crime of causing damage to a computer or information, as charged in  [Count ___] of the indictment, has [two][three] essential elements, which are:  One, the defendant[s] intentionally accessed a protected computer without  authorization; and  Two, the defendant[s], as a result of such conduct, [recklessly caused  damage][caused damage and loss];  [Three, as a result of such conduct, the defendant[s] caused:  •	  •	  •	  •	 •	 •	  •	  [loss	to	one	or	more	persons	during	any	one	year	period	of	an	aggre- gate value of $5,000.00 or more] [loss	resulting	from	a	related	course	of	conduct	affecting	one	or	more	 other protected computers of an aggregate value of $5,000.00 or  more]  [the	[potential] modification or impairment of the medical examina- tion, diagnosis, treatment, or care of one or more individuals] [physical	injury	to	any	person] [a	threat	to	public	health	or	safety] [damage	affecting	a	computer	used	[by][for] a government entity (de- scribe entity at issue), in furtherance of the administration of justice,  national defense, or national security] [damage	affecting	ten	or	more	protected	computers	during	any	one	 year period]].5    5 In most felony cases charged under 18 U.S.C.
If requested  by a party and if supported by the evidence, the court can submit a “greater and lesser included  offense” instruction that would permit separate findings on the aggravating elements as well as  a charge without such findings (i.e., a misdemeanor).
§ 1030(a)(6) Computer Fraud—Trafficking in Passwords  The crime of trafficking in passwords, as charged in [Count ___] of the  indictment, has three essential elements, which are:  •	  •	  One, the defendant[s] knowingly  [transferred	to	another	person	any	password	or	similar	information	 through which a computer may be accessed without authorization] [obtained	control	of	any	password	or	similar	information	through	 which a computer may be accessed without authorization, with the  intent to transfer it to another person]6;  Two, the defendant[s] acted with the intent to defraud; and  Three, •	 •	  [the	defendant[s]’s	act[s]	affected	[interstate][foreign] commerce] [the	computer	was	used	[by][for] the United States government].

Appendix B   171  172    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  Appendix C Best Practices for  Working with Companies  Intrusion crimes can damage or impair the functioning of computers and  networks.
Victims may be the intended targets of the intrusion or third parties  whose systems are used to carry out unlawful activity, such as universities and  Internet service providers.
After a company reports an intrusion, there are a  number of “best practices” for law enforcement that can make the relationship  between law enforcement and companies more productive in the aftermath  of  a  computer  incident.
The  practices  discussed  here  are  designed  to  be  implemented in addition to, not in lieu of, the Attorney General Guidelines  for Victim and Witness Assistance.1 Also, please see appendix E for guides for  first responders and on the mechanics of seizing computer evidence.
Because  computer  information  systems  are  essential  to  the  everyday  operation  of  most  businesses,  the  disruption  of  those  services  can  cripple  a  company.
Also, companies usually wish to avoid the  negative publicity frequently associated with a breach of network security.
Because victims play an important role in providing computer logs and  factual testimony regarding the intrusion, we also suggest some “best practices”  for companies to consider when responding to a network crime.
These suggested  practices are in Appendix D.  In general, law enforcement should seek to build a trusted relationship with  companies.
§ 3771(a) are honored, including the rights to: reasonable	protection	from	the	accused accurate	and	timely	notice	of	court	proceedings	involving	the	crime	 or of any release or escape of the accused  •	 •	  •	 not	be	excluded	from	any	such	public	court	proceeding,	unless	the	 court determines that testimony by the victim would be materially  altered if the victim heard other testimony at that proceeding  •	 be	heard	at	any	public	proceeding	in	the	district	court	involving	  release, plea, sentencing, or probation confer	with	the	government	attorney	on	the	case full	and	timely	restitution	as	provided	in	law  •	 •	 •	 proceedings	free	from	unreasonable	delay •	 be	treated	with	fairness	and	with	respect	for	the	victim’s	dignity	and	  privacy.
Consult with Senior Management Consulting  with  the  company’s  senior  management  before  undertaking  investigative  measures  on  the  company’s  network  will  often  pay  dividends.
Some decisions require the authorization of a company’s senior management.
Consult with Information Technology Staff Whenever possible, we suggest consulting with the company’s information  technology staff about network architecture before implementing investigative  measures on the network.
Working closely with the information technology staff  will help to obtain important information, including information regarding  network topology.
Helpful information will include the type and version of  software being run on the network and any peculiarities in the architecture of the  network, such as proprietary hardware or software.
Obtaining this information   174    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  will help to ensure that law enforcement can obtain all information relevant  to an investigation and minimize disruption of the company’s network from  investigative measures.
Specific things to identify in a network include the locations of intrusion  detection systems, network switches, and firewalls.
Also, identify all data logs,  including the type of data being logged, the size of the log files (to check for  losing data due to rolling retention), and location of the logs (sent to a log server  or maintained on the hacked system and subject to compromise themselves).
Minimize Disruption to the Company Law enforcement should make every effort to use investigative measures that  minimize computer downtime and displacement of a company’s employees.
Some investigative measures are indispensable despite the inconvenience to a  company.
Also, consider practical issues such as whether raid jackets  or other insignia are appropriate to display.
Coordinate Media Releases Investigations and prosecutions of cybercrime cases may entail the release  of information by law enforcement in press releases or press conferences.
Additionally, public statements to the news media should also be coordinated  with  the  company  to  ensure  that  these  statements  do  not  needlessly  reveal  information harmful to a company.
Informing companies of this coordination  at  an  early  stage  in  the  investigation  is  an  important  step.
Law enforcement should take all possible  measures  to  prevent  unauthorized  releases  of  information  about  pending  investigations and to punish unauthorized disclosures when they occur.
This  will prevent the company from releasing information that could damage the  investigation.
Keep the Company Informed About the Investigation After  conducting  the  initial  on-site  investigation,  law  enforcement  may  have little direct contact with a company.
To the extent possible—recognizing  the need to guard against disclosure of grand jury information or information  that could otherwise jeopardize the investigation—keep the company informed  of the progress of the investigation.
For example, forming liaison groups comprised  of law enforcement and private industry representatives can help bridge gaps  of mistrust or unfamiliarity and increase future cybercrime reporting by private  industry.
176    Prosecuting Computer Crimes  Appendix D Best Practices for Victim  Response and Reporting  A quick and effective response by a company is critical for stopping an  ongoing attack and preventing future attacks.
Moreover, the use of established  procedures—including preservation of evidence—and notification to incident- reporting organizations and/or to law enforcement will help to secure systems  of other victims or potential victims.
Use of the practices discussed below by  companies may help to minimize damage to computer networks from attacks  and maximize opportunities to find the attacker.
Because victims play an important role in providing computer logs and  factual testimony regarding the intrusion, we also suggest some “best practices”  for  companies  to  consider  when  responding  to  a  network  crime,  including  reporting  incidents  to  law  enforcement  and  to  data  subjects.
Companies,  universities, and other organizations should consider these practices as part of  their contingency planning before they are attacked, so they are prepared to  respond appropriately when attacked.
While these practices are designed to assist network operators and system  administrators, it is important for investigators and prosecutors to be familiar  with these practices as well.
Law enforcement also may have  opportunities for outreach to organizations that are considering contingency  planning for future network attacks or to organizations that are considering  remedial steps (e.g., changes to company procedures) after they have responded  to a network crime.
Be Familiar with Procedures, Practices, and Contacts Organizations should have procedures in place to handle computer incidents.
These  procedures  should  be  reviewed  periodically  and  made  available  to  all  personnel  who  have  system  security  responsibilities.
Ideally,  those procedures should specify: who in the organization has lead responsibility  for internal incident response; who are the points-of-contact inside and outside  the organization; what criteria will be used to ascertain whether data owners or  subjects of any data taken by the attackers must be notified; and at what point  law enforcement and a computer incident-reporting organization should be  notified.
For  this  reason,  organizations  should  consider  deploying  written  warnings,  or  “banners,”  on  the  ports  through  which an intruder is likely to access the organization’s system and on which  the organization may attempt to monitor an intruder’s communications and  traffic.
Make an Initial Identification and Assessment The first step for an organization is to make an initial identification of the  type of incident that has occurred or is occurring and to confirm that it is,  in fact, an incident.
The network administrator should determine the nature  and scope of the problem—i.e., which specific systems were affected and in  what ways they were affected.
Indicators that an intrusion or other incident  has occurred will typically include evidence that files or logs were accessed,  created,  modified,  deleted  or  copied,  or  that  user  accounts  or  permissions  have  been  added  or  altered.
In  the  case  of  a  root-level  intrusion,  attention  should be paid to any signs that the intruder has gained access to multiple areas  of  the  system—some  of  which  may  remain  undetected.
Using  network  log  information, the system administrator should determine: (a) the immediate  origin of the attack; (b) the identity of servers to which the data were sent (if  information was transferred); and (c) the identity of any other victims.
Take Steps to Minimize Continuing Damage After the scope of the incident has been determined, an organization may  need to take certain steps to stop continuing damage from an ongoing assault on  its network.
Such steps may include installing filters to block a denial of service  attack or isolating all or parts of the system.
In the case of unauthorized access  or access that exceeds user authorization, a system administrator may decide  either to block further illegal access or to watch the illegal activity in order to  identify the source of the attack and/or learn the scope of the compromise.
The  initial  response  should  include  at  a  minimum  documenting:  users  currently  logged  on,  current  connections,  processes  running,  all  listening  sockets and their associated applications.
The organization should also image  the RAM of the attacked systems.
Such information may be important for recovery of damages  from responsible parties and for any subsequent criminal investigation.
Notify Law Enforcement If  at  any  point  during  the  organization’s  response  or  investigation  it  suspects that the incident constitutes criminal activity, law enforcement should  be contacted immediately.
To the extent permitted by law, information already  gathered should be shared with law enforcement.
This is a result that technical fixes to the network  cannot duplicate with the same effectiveness.
However, it is not uncommon for an intruder to   Appendix D   179  install a “back door” through which he can continue to access the system after  the  initial  point  of  compromise  is  repaired.
Catching  and  prosecuting  the  intruder may be the only method to truly secure the organization’s system from  future attacks by the culprit.
In addition, by using the criminal justice system to punish the intruder,  other would-be intruders may be deterred from attacking the organization’s  networks.
Criminal law enforcement can thus play a significant and long-term  role in network security.
Do Not Hack into or Damage the Source Computer Although it may be tempting to do so (especially if the attack is ongoing),  the  company  should  not  take  any  offensive  measures  on  its  own,  such  as  “hacking back” into the attacker’s computer—even if such measures could in  theory be characterized as “defensive.” Doing so may be illegal, regardless of  the motive.
Record and Collect Information       A system administrator for the company should consider making an im-   mediate identical copy of the affected system, which will preserve a record of  the system at the time of the incident for later analysis.
In addition, access to this media should be controlled to maintain  the integrity of the copy’s authenticity, to keep undetected insiders away from  it, and to establish a simple chain of custody.
These steps will enhance the value  of any backups as evidence in any later internal investigations, civil suits, or  criminal prosecutions.
180    Prosecuting Computer Crimes       Notes, Records, and Data As  the  investigation  progresses,  information  that  was  collected  by  the  company  contemporaneous  to  the  events  may  take  on  great  significance.
The  types  of  information  that  should  be  recorded  by  the  company   include:  •	  •	 description	of	all	incident-related	events,	including	dates	and	times •	 information	about	incident-related	phone	calls,	emails,	and	other	 contacts the	identity	of	persons	working	on	tasks	related	to	the	intrusion,	 including a description, the amount of time spent, and the  approximate hourly rate for those persons’ work identity	of	the	systems,	accounts,	services,	data,	and	networks	affected	 by the incident, and a description of how these network components  were affected information	relating	to	the	amount	and	type	of	damage	inflicted	by	 the incident, which can be important in civil actions by the company  and in criminal cases.
A system administrator may be able to use a “sniffer”  or other monitoring device to record communications between the intruder   Appendix D   181  and any server that is under attack.
A  banner  should  notify  users  or  intruders  as  they  access  or  log  into  a  system that their continued use of the system constitutes their consent to being  monitored and that the results of such monitoring may be disclosed to law  enforcement and others.
To  avoid  being  the  victim  of  social  engineering  and  risking  further  damage  to  the  organization’s network, employees of the company should not disclose incident- specific information to callers who are not known points-of-contact, unless the  employee can verify the identity and authority of those persons.
Suspicious  calls, emails, or other requests for information should be treated as part of the  incident investigation.
Notify     People Within the Organization    Appropriate people in the organization should be notified immediately about  the incident and provided with the results of any preliminary investigation.
This  may  include  security  coordinators,  managers,  and  legal  counsel.
(A  written policy for incident response should set out points-of-contact within  the organization and the circumstances for contacting them.)
If the company suspects that the perpetrator of an attack is an insider, or  may have insider information, the company may wish to strictly limit incident  information to a need-to-know basis.
182    Prosecuting Computer Crimes       Computer Incident-reporting Organization Whenever  possible,  the  company  should  notify  an  incident-reporting  organization,  such  as  a  Computer  Emergency  Response  Team  (CERT).
The  United  States  Computer  Emergency  Readiness  Team  (US-CERT)  is  a  partnership  between  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  and  the  public and private sectors.
Established in 2003 to protect the nation’s Internet  infrastructure,  US-CERT  is  charged  with  coordinating  defense  against  and  response  to  cyber  attacks.
US-CERT  interacts  with  federal  agencies,  industry, the research community, state and local governments, and others to  disseminate reasoned and actionable cyber security information to the public.
US-CERT also provides a way for citizens, businesses, and other institutions to  communicate and coordinate directly with the United States government about  cyber security.
They can  be contacted on the Internet at http://www.us-cert.gov.
Other Potential Victims If there is another organization, or a vulnerability in a vendor’s product  that is being exploited, it may be prudent for the company to notify the victim  or vendor to request that an incident-reporting organization or CERT alert the  victim or vendor.
The third-party victim or vendor may be able to provide new  and previously unknown information about the incident (e.g., hidden code,  ongoing investigations in other areas, or network configuration techniques).
Note also that state laws may require companies to notify people whose  data is compromised during an intrusion.
For example, California law requires  that:  [a]ny person or business that conducts business in California,  and  that  owns  or  licenses  computerized  data  that  includes  personal information, shall disclose any breach of the security  of the system following discovery or notification of the breach  in the security of the data to any resident of California whose   Appendix D   183  unencrypted  personal  information  was,  or  is  reasonably  believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person.
At least one state law allows the database owner to elect against providing  notice to data subjects if the database owner consults with law enforcement  and thereafter determines that the breach “will not likely result in harm to  the individuals whose personal information has been acquired and accessed.”  Conn. S.B.
In  order to keep similar incidents from occurring, victims should do conduct a  post-incident review of the organization’s response to the attack and assessment  of the strengths and weaknesses of this response.
Part of the assessment should  include ascertaining whether each of the steps outlined above occurred.
